(1, 'The Gift of the Magi', 'One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all. And sixty cents of it was in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one\'s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied. Three times Della counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be Christmas.\r\n\r\nThere was clearly nothing left to do but flop down on the shabby little couch and howl. So Della did it. Which instigates the moral reflection that life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, with sniffles predominating.\r\n\r\nWhile the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the first stage to the second, take a look at the home. A furnished flat at $8 per week. It did not exactly beggar description, but it certainly had that word on the look-out for the mendicancy squad.\r\n\r\nIn the vestibule below was a letter-box into which no letter would go, and an electric button from which no mortal finger could coax a ring. Also appertaining thereunto was a card bearing the name \"Mr. James Dillingham Young.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Dillingham\" had been flung to the breeze during a former period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid $30 per week. Now, when the income was shrunk to $20, the letters of \"Dillingham\" looked blurred, as though they were thinking seriously of contracting to a modest and unassuming D. But whenever Mr. James Dillingham Young came home and reached his flat above he was called \"Jim\" and greatly hugged by Mrs. James Dillingham Young, already introduced to you as Della. Which is all very good.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nDella finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder rag. She stood by the window and looked out dully at a grey cat walking a grey fence in a grey backyard. To-morrow would be Christmas Day, and she had only $1.87 with which to buy Jim a present. She had been saving every penny she could for months, with this result. Twenty dollars a week doesn\'t go far. Expenses had been greater than she had calculated. They always are. Only $1.87 to buy a present for Jim. Her Jim. Many a happy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him. Something fine and rare and sterling--something just a little bit near to being worthy of the honour of being owned by Jim.\r\n\r\nThere was a pier-glass between the windows of the room. Perhaps you have seen a pier-glass in an $8 Bat. A very thin and very agile person may, by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal strips, obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks. Della, being slender, had mastered the art.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the glass. Her eyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its colour within twenty seconds. Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nNow, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham Youngs in which they both took a mighty pride. One was Jim\'s gold watch that had been his father\'s and his grandfather\'s. The other was Della\'s hair. Had the Queen of Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft, Della would have let her hair hang out of the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her Majesty\'s jewels and gifts. Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all his treasures piled up in the basement, Jim would have pulled out his watch every time he passed, just to see him pluck at his beard from envy.\r\n\r\nSo now Della\'s beautiful hair fell about her, rippling and shining like a cascade of brown waters. It reached below her knee and made itself almost a garment for her. And then she did it up again nervously and quickly. Once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet.\r\n\r\nOn went her old brown jacket; on went her old brown hat. With a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her eyes, she cluttered out of the door and down the stairs to the street.\r\n\r\nWhere she stopped the sign read: \"Mme Sofronie. Hair Goods of All Kinds.\" One Eight up Della ran, and collected herself, panting. Madame, large, too white, chilly, hardly looked the \"Sofronie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you buy my hair?\" asked Della.\r\n\r\n\"I buy hair,\" said Madame. \"Take yer hat off and let\'s have a sight at the looks of it.\"\r\n\r\nDown rippled the brown cascade.\r\n\r\n\"Twenty dollars,\" said Madame, lifting the mass with a practised hand.\r\n\r\n\"Give it to me quick\" said Della.\r\n\r\nOh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings. Forget the hashed metaphor. She was ransacking the stores for Jim\'s present.\r\n\r\nShe found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one else. There was no other like it in any of the stores, and she had turned all of them inside out. It was a platinum fob chain simple and chaste in design, properly proclaiming its value by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentation--as all good things should do. It was even worthy of The Watch. As soon as she saw it she knew that it must be Jim\'s. It was like him. Quietness and value--the description applied to both. Twenty-one dollars they took from her for it, and she hurried home with the 78 cents. With that chain on his watch Jim might be properly anxious about the time in any company. Grand as the watch was, he sometimes looked at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that he used in place of a chain.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nWhen Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to prudence and reason. She got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and went to work repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love. Which is always a tremendous task dear friends--a mammoth task.\r\n\r\nWithin forty minutes her head was covered with tiny, close-lying curls that made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy. She looked at her reflection in the mirror long, carefully, and critically.\r\n\r\n\"If Jim doesn\'t kill me,\" she said to herself, \"before he takes a second look at me, he\'ll say I look like a Coney Island chorus girl. But what could I do--oh! what could I do with a dollar and eighty-seven cents?\"\r\n\r\nAt 7 o\'clock the coffee was made and the frying-pan was on the back of the stove hot and ready to cook the chops.\r\n\r\nJim was never late. Della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat on the corner of the table near the door that he always entered. Then she heard his step on the stair away down on the first flight, and she turned white for just a moment. She had a habit of saying little silent prayers about the simplest everyday things, and now she whispered: \"Please, God, make him think I am still pretty.\"\r\n\r\nThe door opened and Jim stepped in and closed it. He looked thin and very serious. Poor fellow, he was only twenty-two--and to be burdened with a family! He needed a new overcoat and he was with out gloves.\r\n\r\nJim stepped inside the door, as immovable as a setter at the scent of quail. His eyes were fixed upon Della, and there was an expression in them that she could not read, and it terrified her. It was not anger, nor surprise, nor disapproval, nor horror, nor any of the sentiments that she had been prepared for. He simply stared at her fixedly with that peculiar expression on his face.\r\n\r\nDella wriggled off the table and went for him.\r\n\r\n\"Jim, darling,\" she cried, \"don\'t look at me that way. I had my hair cut off and sold it because I couldn\'t have lived through Christmas without giving you a present. It\'ll grow out again--you won\'t mind, will you? I just had to do it. My hair grows awfully fast. Say \'Merry Christmas!\' Jim, and let\'s be happy. You don\'t know what a nice-what a beautiful, nice gift I\'ve got for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You\'ve cut off your hair?\" asked Jim, laboriously, as if he had not arrived at that patent fact yet, even after the hardest mental labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\"Cut it off and sold it,\" said Della. \"Don\'t you like me just as well, anyhow? I\'m me without my hair, ain\'t I?\"\r\n\r\nJim looked about the room curiously.\r\n\r\n\"You say your hair is gone?\" he said, with an air almost of idiocy.\r\n\r\n\"You needn\'t look for it,\" said Della. \"It\'s sold, I tell you--sold and gone, too. It\'s Christmas Eve, boy. Be good to me, for it went for you. Maybe the hairs of my head were numbered,\" she went on with a sudden serious sweetness, \"but nobody could ever count my love for you. Shall I put the chops on, Jim?\"\r\n\r\nOut of his trance Jim seemed quickly to wake. He enfolded his Della. For ten seconds let us regard with discreet scrutiny some inconsequential object in the other direction. Eight dollars a week or a million a year--what is the difference? A mathematician or a wit would give you the wrong answer. The magi brought valuable gifts, but that was not among them. This dark assertion will be illuminated later on.\r\n\r\nJim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it upon the table.\r\n\r\n\"Don\'t make any mistake, Dell,\" he said, \"about me. I don\'t think there\'s anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo that could make me like my girl any less. But if you\'ll unwrap that package you may see why you had me going a while at first.\"\r\n\r\nWhite fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper. And then an ecstatic scream of joy; and then, alas! a quick feminine change to hysterical tears and wails, necessitating the immediate employment of all the comforting powers of the lord of the flat.\r\n\r\nFor there lay The Combs--the set of combs, side and back, that Della had worshipped for long in a Broadway window. Beautiful combs, pure tortoise-shell, with jewelled rims--just the shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair. They were expensive combs, she knew, and her heart had simply craved and yearned over them without the least hope of possession. And now, they were hers, but the tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were gone.\r\n\r\nBut she hugged them to her bosom, and at length she was able to look up with dim eyes and a smile and say: \"My hair grows so fast, Jim!\"\r\n\r\nAnd then Della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried, \"Oh, oh!\"\r\n\r\nJim had not yet seen his beautiful present. She held it out to him eagerly upon her open palm. The dull precious metal seemed to flash with a reflection of her bright and ardent spirit.\r\n\r\n\"Isn\'t it a dandy, Jim? I hunted all over town to find it. You\'ll have to look at the time a hundred times a day now. Give me your watch. I want to see how it looks on it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nInstead of obeying, Jim tumbled down on the couch and put his hands under the back of his head and smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Dell,\" said he, \"let\'s put our Christmas presents away and keep \'em a while. They\'re too nice to use just at present. I sold the watch to get the money to buy your combs. And now suppose you put the chops on.\"\r\n\r\nThe magi, as you know, were wise men--wonderfully wise men-who brought gifts to the Babe in the manger. They invented the art of giving Christmas presents. Being wise, their gifts were no doubt wise ones, possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication. And here I have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house. But in a last word to the wise of these days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest. Of all who give and receive gifts, such as they are wisest. Everywhere they are wisest. They are the magi.', 'This story was originally published on Dec 10, 1905, in The New York Sunday World as \"Gifts of the Magi.\" It was subsequently published as The Gift of the Magi in O. Henry\'s 1906 short story collection The Four Million.', 1, '2020-02-02 11:08:02', '2020-02-02 11:08:02'),
(2, 'The Little Match Girl', 'Most terribly cold it was; it snowed, and was nearly quite dark, and evening-- the last evening of the year. In this cold and darkness there went along the street a poor little girl, bareheaded, and with naked feet. When she left home she had slippers on, it is true; but what was the good of that? They were very large slippers, which her mother had hitherto worn; so large were they; and the poor little thing lost them as she scuffled away across the street, because of two carriages that rolled by dreadfully fast.\r\n\r\nOne slipper was nowhere to be found; the other had been laid hold of by an urchin, and off he ran with it; he thought it would do capitally for a cradle when he some day or other should have children himself. So the little maiden walked on with her tiny naked feet, that were quite red and blue from cold. She carried a quantity of matches in an old apron, and she held a bundle of them in her hand. Nobody had bought anything of her the whole livelong day; no one had given her a single farthing.\r\n\r\nShe crept along trembling with cold and hunger--a very picture of sorrow, the poor little thing!\r\n\r\nThe flakes of snow covered her long fair hair, which fell in beautiful curls around her neck; but of that, of course, she never once now thought. From all the windows the candles were gleaming, and it smelt so deliciously of roast goose, for you know it was New Year\'s Eve; yes, of that she thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nIn a corner formed by two houses, of which one advanced more than the other, she seated herself down and cowered together. Her little feet she had drawn close up to her, but she grew colder and colder, and to go home she did not venture, for she had not sold any matches and could not bring a farthing of money: from her father she would certainly get blows, and at home it was cold too, for above her she had only the roof, through which the wind whistled, even though the largest cracks were stopped up with straw and rags.\r\n\r\nHer little hands were almost numbed with cold. Oh! a match might afford her a world of comfort, if she only dared take a single one out of the bundle, draw it against the wall, and warm her fingers by it. She drew one out. \"Rischt!\" how it blazed, how it burnt! It was a warm, bright flame, like a candle, as she held her hands over it: it was a wonderful light. It seemed really to the little maiden as though she were sitting before a large iron stove, with burnished brass feet and a brass ornament at top. The fire burned with such blessed influence; it warmed so delightfully. The little girl had already stretched out her feet to warm them too; but--the small flame went out, the stove vanished: she had only the remains of the burnt-out match in her hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nShe rubbed another against the wall: it burned brightly, and where the light fell on the wall, there the wall became transparent like a veil, so that she could see into the room. On the table was spread a snow-white tablecloth; upon it was a splendid porcelain service, and the roast goose was steaming famously with its stuffing of apple and dried plums. And what was still more capital to behold was, the goose hopped down from the dish, reeled about on the floor with knife and fork in its breast, till it came up to the poor little girl; when--the match went out and nothing but the thick, cold, damp wall was left behind. She lighted another match. Now there she was sitting under the most magnificent Christmas tree: it was still larger, and more decorated than the one which she had seen through the glass door in the rich merchant\'s house.\r\n\r\nThousands of lights were burning on the green branches, and gaily-colored pictures, such as she had seen in the shop-windows, looked down upon her. The little maiden stretched out her hands towards them when--the match went out. The lights of the Christmas tree rose higher and higher, she saw them now as stars in heaven; one fell down and formed a long trail of fire.\r\n\r\n\"Someone is just dead!\" said the little girl; for her old grandmother, the only person who had loved her, and who was now no more, had told her, that when a star falls, a soul ascends to God.\r\n\r\nShe drew another match against the wall: it was again light, and in the lustre there stood the old grandmother, so bright and radiant, so mild, and with such an expression of love.\r\n\r\n\"Grandmother!\" cried the little one. \"Oh, take me with you! You go away when the match burns out; you vanish like the warm stove, like the delicious roast goose, and like the magnificent Christmas tree!\" And she rubbed the whole bundle of matches quickly against the wall, for she wanted to be quite sure of keeping her grandmother near her. And the matches gave such a brilliant light that it was brighter than at noon-day: never formerly had the grandmother been so beautiful and so tall. She took the little maiden, on her arm, and both flew in brightness and in joy so high, so very high, and then above was neither cold, nor hunger, nor anxiety--they were with God.\r\n\r\nBut in the corner, at the cold hour of dawn, sat the poor girl, with rosy cheeks and with a smiling mouth, leaning against the wall--frozen to death on the last evening of the old year. Stiff and stark sat the child there with her matches, of which one bundle had been burnt. \"She wanted to warm herself,\" people said. No one had the slightest suspicion of what beautiful things she had seen; no one even dreamed of the splendor in which, with her grandmother she had entered on the joys of a new year.', 'The Little Match Girl, also titled, The Little Matchstick Girl is one of our Favorite Fairy Tales. Published by Hans Christian Andersen in 1845, it exemplifies his broad literary talent and ability. I personally like to read this story at least twice a year, once in Autumn as the holiday season comes into focus, and then again around the Christmas holiday. It\'s a gentle reminder of the value of compassion and charity.', 2, '2020-02-02 11:14:06', '2020-02-02 11:14:06');

(8, 'To Build a Fire', 'Day had broken cold and grey, exceedingly cold and grey, when the man turned aside from the main Yukon trail and climbed the high earth- bank, where a dim and little-travelled trail led eastward through the fat spruce timberland. It was a steep bank, and he paused for breath at the top, excusing the act to himself by looking at his watch. It was nine o\'clock. There was no sun nor hint of sun, though there was not a cloud in the sky. It was a clear day, and yet there seemed an intangible pall over the face of things, a subtle gloom that made the day dark, and that was due to the absence of sun. This fact did not worry the man. He was used to the lack of sun. It had been days since he had seen the sun, and he knew that a few more days must pass before that cheerful orb, due south, would just peep above the sky- line and dip immediately from view.\r\n\r\nThe man flung a look back along the way he had come. The Yukon lay a mile wide and hidden under three feet of ice. On top of this ice were as many feet of snow. It was all pure white, rolling in gentle undulations where the ice-jams of the freeze-up had formed. North and south, as far as his eye could see, it was unbroken white, save for a dark hair-line that curved and twisted from around the spruce- covered island to the south, and that curved and twisted away into the north, where it disappeared behind another spruce-covered island. This dark hair-line was the trail--the main trail--that led south five hundred miles to the Chilcoot Pass, Dyea, and salt water; and that led north seventy miles to Dawson, and still on to the north a thousand miles to Nulato, and finally to St. Michael on Bering Sea, a thousand miles and half a thousand more.\r\n\r\nBut all this--the mysterious, far-reaching hairline trail, the absence of sun from the sky, the tremendous cold, and the strangeness and weirdness of it all--made no impression on the man. It was not because he was long used to it. He was a new-comer in the land, a chechaquo, and this was his first winter. The trouble with him was that he was without imagination. He was quick and alert in the things of life, but only in the things, and not in the significances. Fifty degrees below zero meant eighty odd degrees of frost. Such fact impressed him as being cold and uncomfortable, and that was all. It did not lead him to meditate upon his frailty as a creature of temperature, and upon man\'s frailty in general, able only to live within certain narrow limits of heat and cold; and from there on it did not lead him to the conjectural field of immortality and man\'s place in the universe. Fifty degrees below zero stood for a bite of frost that hurt and that must be guarded against by the use of mittens, ear-flaps, warm moccasins, and thick socks. Fifty degrees below zero was to him just precisely fifty degrees below zero. That there should be anything more to it than that was a thought that never entered his head.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nAs he turned to go on, he spat speculatively. There was a sharp, explosive crackle that startled him. He spat again. And again, in the air, before it could fall to the snow, the spittle crackled. He knew that at fifty below spittle crackled on the snow, but this spittle had crackled in the air. Undoubtedly it was colder than fifty below--how much colder he did not know. But the temperature did not matter. He was bound for the old claim on the left fork of Henderson Creek, where the boys were already. They had come over across the divide from the Indian Creek country, while he had come the roundabout way to take a look at the possibilities of getting out logs in the spring from the islands in the Yukon. He would be in to camp by six o\'clock; a bit after dark, it was true, but the boys would be there, a fire would be going, and a hot supper would be ready. As for lunch, he pressed his hand against the protruding bundle under his jacket. It was also under his shirt, wrapped up in a handkerchief and lying against the naked skin. It was the only way to keep the biscuits from freezing. He smiled agreeably to himself as he thought of those biscuits, each cut open and sopped in bacon grease, and each enclosing a generous slice of fried bacon.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nHe plunged in among the big spruce trees. The trail was faint. A foot of snow had fallen since the last sled had passed over, and he was glad he was without a sled, travelling light. In fact, he carried nothing but the lunch wrapped in the handkerchief. He was surprised, however, at the cold. It certainly was cold, he concluded, as he rubbed his numbed nose and cheek-bones with his mittened hand. He was a warm-whiskered man, but the hair on his face did not protect the high cheek-bones and the eager nose that thrust itself aggressively into the frosty air.\r\n\r\nAt the man\'s heels trotted a dog, a big native husky, the proper wolf-dog, grey-coated and without any visible or temperamental difference from its brother, the wild wolf. The animal was depressed by the tremendous cold. It knew that it was no time for travelling. Its instinct told it a truer tale than was told to the man by the man\'s judgment. In reality, it was not merely colder than fifty below zero; it was colder than sixty below, than seventy below. It was seventy-five below zero. Since the freezing-point is thirty-two above zero, it meant that one hundred and seven degrees of frost obtained. The dog did not know anything about thermometers. Possibly in its brain there was no sharp consciousness of a condition of very cold such as was in the man\'s brain. But the brute had its instinct. It experienced a vague but menacing apprehension that subdued it and made it slink along at the man\'s heels, and that made it question eagerly every unwonted movement of the man as if expecting him to go into camp or to seek shelter somewhere and build a fire. The dog had learned fire, and it wanted fire, or else to burrow under the snow and cuddle its warmth away from the air.\r\n\r\nThe frozen moisture of its breathing had settled on its fur in a fine powder of frost, and especially were its jowls, muzzle, and eyelashes whitened by its crystalled breath. The man\'s red beard and moustache were likewise frosted, but more solidly, the deposit taking the form of ice and increasing with every warm, moist breath he exhaled. Also, the man was chewing tobacco, and the muzzle of ice held his lips so rigidly that he was unable to clear his chin when he expelled the juice. The result was that a crystal beard of the colour and solidity of amber was increasing its length on his chin. If he fell down it would shatter itself, like glass, into brittle fragments. But he did not mind the appendage. It was the penalty all tobacco- chewers paid in that country, and he had been out before in two cold snaps. They had not been so cold as this, he knew, but by the spirit thermometer at Sixty Mile he knew they had been registered at fifty below and at fifty-five.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nHe held on through the level stretch of woods for several miles, crossed a wide flat of nigger-heads, and dropped down a bank to the frozen bed of a small stream. This was Henderson Creek, and he knew he was ten miles from the forks. He looked at his watch. It was ten o\'clock. He was making four miles an hour, and he calculated that he would arrive at the forks at half-past twelve. He decided to celebrate that event by eating his lunch there.\r\n\r\nThe dog dropped in again at his heels, with a tail drooping discouragement, as the man swung along the creek-bed. The furrow of the old sled-trail was plainly visible, but a dozen inches of snow covered the marks of the last runners. In a month no man had come up or down that silent creek. The man held steadily on. He was not much given to thinking, and just then particularly he had nothing to think about save that he would eat lunch at the forks and that at six o\'clock he would be in camp with the boys. There was nobody to talk to and, had there been, speech would have been impossible because of the ice-muzzle on his mouth. So he continued monotonously to chew tobacco and to increase the length of his amber beard.\r\n\r\nOnce in a while the thought reiterated itself that it was very cold and that he had never experienced such cold. As he walked along he rubbed his cheek-bones and nose with the back of his mittened hand. He did this automatically, now and again changing hands. But rub as he would, the instant he stopped his cheek-bones went numb, and the following instant the end of his nose went numb. He was sure to frost his cheeks; he knew that, and experienced a pang of regret that he had not devised a nose-strap of the sort Bud wore in cold snaps. Such a strap passed across the cheeks, as well, and saved them. But it didn\'t matter much, after all. What were frosted cheeks? A bit painful, that was all; they were never serious.\r\n\r\nEmpty as the man\'s mind was of thoughts, he was keenly observant, and he noticed the changes in the creek, the curves and bends and timber- jams, and always he sharply noted where he placed his feet. Once, coming around a bend, he shied abruptly, like a startled horse, curved away from the place where he had been walking, and retreated several paces back along the trail. The creek he knew was frozen clear to the bottom--no creek could contain water in that arctic winter--but he knew also that there were springs that bubbled out from the hillsides and ran along under the snow and on top the ice of the creek. He knew that the coldest snaps never froze these springs, and he knew likewise their danger. They were traps. They hid pools of water under the snow that might be three inches deep, or three feet. Sometimes a skin of ice half an inch thick covered them, and in turn was covered by the snow. Sometimes there were alternate layers of water and ice-skin, so that when one broke through he kept on breaking through for a while, sometimes wetting himself to the waist.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nThat was why he had shied in such panic. He had felt the give under his feet and heard the crackle of a snow-hidden ice-skin. And to get his feet wet in such a temperature meant trouble and danger. At the very least it meant delay, for he would be forced to stop and build a fire, and under its protection to bare his feet while he dried his socks and moccasins. He stood and studied the creek-bed and its banks, and decided that the flow of water came from the right. He reflected awhile, rubbing his nose and cheeks, then skirted to the left, stepping gingerly and testing the footing for each step. Once clear of the danger, he took a fresh chew of tobacco and swung along at his four-mile gait.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the next two hours he came upon several similar traps. Usually the snow above the hidden pools had a sunken, candied appearance that advertised the danger. Once again, however, he had a close call; and once, suspecting danger, he compelled the dog to go on in front. The dog did not want to go. It hung back until the man shoved it forward, and then it went quickly across the white, unbroken surface. Suddenly it broke through, floundered to one side, and got away to firmer footing. It had wet its forefeet and legs, and almost immediately the water that clung to it turned to ice. It made quick efforts to lick the ice off its legs, then dropped down in the snow and began to bite out the ice that had formed between the toes. This was a matter of instinct. To permit the ice to remain would mean sore feet. It did not know this. It merely obeyed the mysterious prompting that arose from the deep crypts of its being. But the man knew, having achieved a judgment on the subject, and he removed the mitten from his right hand and helped tear out the ice- particles. He did not expose his fingers more than a minute, and was astonished at the swift numbness that smote them. It certainly was cold. He pulled on the mitten hastily, and beat the hand savagely across his chest.\r\n\r\nAt twelve o\'clock the day was at its brightest. Yet the sun was too far south on its winter journey to clear the horizon. The bulge of the earth intervened between it and Henderson Creek, where the man walked under a clear sky at noon and cast no shadow. At half-past twelve, to the minute, he arrived at the forks of the creek. He was pleased at the speed he had made. If he kept it up, he would certainly be with the boys by six. He unbuttoned his jacket and shirt and drew forth his lunch. The action consumed no more than a quarter of a minute, yet in that brief moment the numbness laid hold of the exposed fingers. He did not put the mitten on, but, instead, struck the fingers a dozen sharp smashes against his leg. Then he sat down on a snow-covered log to eat. The sting that followed upon the striking of his fingers against his leg ceased so quickly that he was startled, he had had no chance to take a bite of biscuit. He struck the fingers repeatedly and returned them to the mitten, baring the other hand for the purpose of eating. He tried to take a mouthful, but the ice-muzzle prevented. He had forgotten to build a fire and thaw out. He chuckled at his foolishness, and as he chuckled he noted the numbness creeping into the exposed fingers. Also, he noted that the stinging which had first come to his toes when he sat down was already passing away. He wondered whether the toes were warm or numbed. He moved them inside the moccasins and decided that they were numbed.\r\n\r\nHe pulled the mitten on hurriedly and stood up. He was a bit frightened. He stamped up and down until the stinging returned into the feet. It certainly was cold, was his thought. That man from Sulphur Creek had spoken the truth when telling how cold it sometimes got in the country. And he had laughed at him at the time! That showed one must not be too sure of things. There was no mistake about it, it was cold. He strode up and down, stamping his feet and threshing his arms, until reassured by the returning warmth. Then he got out matches and proceeded to make a fire. From the undergrowth, where high water of the previous spring had lodged a supply of seasoned twigs, he got his firewood. Working carefully from a small beginning, he soon had a roaring fire, over which he thawed the ice from his face and in the protection of which he ate his biscuits. For the moment the cold of space was outwitted. The dog took satisfaction in the fire, stretching out close enough for warmth and far enough away to escape being singed.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nWhen the man had finished, he filled his pipe and took his comfortable time over a smoke. Then he pulled on his mittens, settled the ear-flaps of his cap firmly about his ears, and took the creek trail up the left fork. The dog was disappointed and yearned back toward the fire. This man did not know cold. Possibly all the generations of his ancestry had been ignorant of cold, of real cold, of cold one hundred and seven degrees below freezing-point. But the dog knew; all its ancestry knew, and it had inherited the knowledge. And it knew that it was not good to walk abroad in such fearful cold. It was the time to lie snug in a hole in the snow and wait for a curtain of cloud to be drawn across the face of outer space whence this cold came. On the other hand, there was keen intimacy between the dog and the man. The one was the toil-slave of the other, and the only caresses it had ever received were the caresses of the whip- lash and of harsh and menacing throat-sounds that threatened the whip-lash. So the dog made no effort to communicate its apprehension to the man. It was not concerned in the welfare of the man; it was for its own sake that it yearned back toward the fire. But the man whistled, and spoke to it with the sound of whip-lashes, and the dog swung in at the man\'s heels and followed after.\r\n\r\nThe man took a chew of tobacco and proceeded to start a new amber beard. Also, his moist breath quickly powdered with white his moustache, eyebrows, and lashes. There did not seem to be so many springs on the left fork of the Henderson, and for half an hour the man saw no signs of any. And then it happened. At a place where there were no signs, where the soft, unbroken snow seemed to advertise solidity beneath, the man broke through. It was not deep. He wetted himself half-way to the knees before he floundered out to the firm crust.\r\n\r\nHe was angry, and cursed his luck aloud. He had hoped to get into camp with the boys at six o\'clock, and this would delay him an hour, for he would have to build a fire and dry out his foot-gear. This was imperative at that low temperature--he knew that much; and he turned aside to the bank, which he climbed. On top, tangled in the underbrush about the trunks of several small spruce trees, was a high-water deposit of dry firewood--sticks and twigs principally, but also larger portions of seasoned branches and fine, dry, last-year\'s grasses. He threw down several large pieces on top of the snow. This served for a foundation and prevented the young flame from drowning itself in the snow it otherwise would melt. The flame he got by touching a match to a small shred of birch-bark that he took from his pocket. This burned even more readily than paper. Placing it on the foundation, he fed the young flame with wisps of dry grass and with the tiniest dry twigs.\r\n\r\nHe worked slowly and carefully, keenly aware of his danger. Gradually, as the flame grew stronger, he increased the size of the twigs with which he fed it. He squatted in the snow, pulling the twigs out from their entanglement in the brush and feeding directly to the flame. He knew there must be no failure. When it is seventy- five below zero, a man must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire--that is, if his feet are wet. If his feet are dry, and he fails, he can run along the trail for half a mile and restore his circulation. But the circulation of wet and freezing feet cannot be restored by running when it is seventy-five below. No matter how fast he runs, the wet feet will freeze the harder.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nAll this the man knew. The old-timer on Sulphur Creek had told him about it the previous fall, and now he was appreciating the advice. Already all sensation had gone out of his feet. To build the fire he had been forced to remove his mittens, and the fingers had quickly gone numb. His pace of four miles an hour had kept his heart pumping blood to the surface of his body and to all the extremities. But the instant he stopped, the action of the pump eased down. The cold of space smote the unprotected tip of the planet, and he, being on that unprotected tip, received the full force of the blow. The blood of his body recoiled before it. The blood was alive, like the dog, and like the dog it wanted to hide away and cover itself up from the fearful cold. So long as he walked four miles an hour, he pumped that blood, willy-nilly, to the surface; but now it ebbed away and sank down into the recesses of his body. The extremities were the first to feel its absence. His wet feet froze the faster, and his exposed fingers numbed the faster, though they had not yet begun to freeze. Nose and cheeks were already freezing, while the skin of all his body chilled as it lost its blood.\r\n\r\nBut he was safe. Toes and nose and cheeks would be only touched by the frost, for the fire was beginning to burn with strength. He was feeding it with twigs the size of his finger. In another minute he would be able to feed it with branches the size of his wrist, and then he could remove his wet foot-gear, and, while it dried, he could keep his naked feet warm by the fire, rubbing them at first, of course, with snow. The fire was a success. He was safe. He remembered the advice of the old-timer on Sulphur Creek, and smiled. The old-timer had been very serious in laying down the law that no man must travel alone in the Klondike after fifty below. Well, here he was; he had had the accident; he was alone; and he had saved himself. Those old-timers were rather womanish, some of them, he thought. All a man had to do was to keep his head, and he was all right. Any man who was a man could travel alone. But it was surprising, the rapidity with which his cheeks and nose were freezing. And he had not thought his fingers could go lifeless in so short a time. Lifeless they were, for he could scarcely make them move together to grip a twig, and they seemed remote from his body and from him. When he touched a twig, he had to look and see whether or not he had hold of it. The wires were pretty well down between him and his finger-ends.\r\n\r\nAll of which counted for little. There was the fire, snapping and crackling and promising life with every dancing flame. He started to untie his moccasins. They were coated with ice; the thick German socks were like sheaths of iron half-way to the knees; and the mocassin strings were like rods of steel all twisted and knotted as by some conflagration. For a moment he tugged with his numbed fingers, then, realizing the folly of it, he drew his sheath-knife.\r\n\r\nBut before he could cut the strings, it happened. It was his own fault or, rather, his mistake. He should not have built the fire under the spruce tree. He should have built it in the open. But it had been easier to pull the twigs from the brush and drop them directly on the fire. Now the tree under which he had done this carried a weight of snow on its boughs. No wind had blown for weeks, and each bough was fully freighted. Each time he had pulled a twig he had communicated a slight agitation to the tree--an imperceptible agitation, so far as he was concerned, but an agitation sufficient to bring about the disaster. High up in the tree one bough capsized its load of snow. This fell on the boughs beneath, capsizing them. This process continued, spreading out and involving the whole tree. It grew like an avalanche, and it descended without warning upon the man and the fire, and the fire was blotted out! Where it had burned was a mantle of fresh and disordered snow.\r\n\r\nThe man was shocked. It was as though he had just heard his own sentence of death. For a moment he sat and stared at the spot where the fire had been. Then he grew very calm. Perhaps the old-timer on Sulphur Creek was right. If he had only had a trail-mate he would have been in no danger now. The trail-mate could have built the fire. Well, it was up to him to build the fire over again, and this second time there must be no failure. Even if he succeeded, he would most likely lose some toes. His feet must be badly frozen by now, and there would be some time before the second fire was ready.\r\n\r\nSuch were his thoughts, but he did not sit and think them. He was busy all the time they were passing through his mind, he made a new foundation for a fire, this time in the open; where no treacherous tree could blot it out. Next, he gathered dry grasses and tiny twigs from the high-water flotsam. He could not bring his fingers together to pull them out, but he was able to gather them by the handful. In this way he got many rotten twigs and bits of green moss that were undesirable, but it was the best he could do. He worked methodically, even collecting an armful of the larger branches to be used later when the fire gathered strength. And all the while the dog sat and watched him, a certain yearning wistfulness in its eyes, for it looked upon him as the fire-provider, and the fire was slow in coming.\r\n\r\nWhen all was ready, the man reached in his pocket for a second piece of birch-bark. He knew the bark was there, and, though he could not feel it with his fingers, he could hear its crisp rustling as he fumbled for it. Try as he would, he could not clutch hold of it. And all the time, in his consciousness, was the knowledge that each instant his feet were freezing. This thought tended to put him in a panic, but he fought against it and kept calm. He pulled on his mittens with his teeth, and threshed his arms back and forth, beating his hands with all his might against his sides. He did this sitting down, and he stood up to do it; and all the while the dog sat in the snow, its wolf-brush of a tail curled around warmly over its forefeet, its sharp wolf-ears pricked forward intently as it watched the man. And the man as he beat and threshed with his arms and hands, felt a great surge of envy as he regarded the creature that was warm and secure in its natural covering.\r\n\r\nAfter a time he was aware of the first far-away signals of sensation in his beaten fingers. The faint tingling grew stronger till it evolved into a stinging ache that was excruciating, but which the man hailed with satisfaction. He stripped the mitten from his right hand and fetched forth the birch-bark. The exposed fingers were quickly going numb again. Next he brought out his bunch of sulphur matches. But the tremendous cold had already driven the life out of his fingers. In his effort to separate one match from the others, the whole bunch fell in the snow. He tried to pick it out of the snow, but failed. The dead fingers could neither touch nor clutch. He was very careful. He drove the thought of his freezing feet; and nose, and cheeks, out of his mind, devoting his whole soul to the matches. He watched, using the sense of vision in place of that of touch, and when he saw his fingers on each side the bunch, he closed them--that is, he willed to close them, for the wires were drawn, and the fingers did not obey. He pulled the mitten on the right hand, and beat it fiercely against his knee. Then, with both mittened hands, he scooped the bunch of matches, along with much snow, into his lap. Yet he was no better off.\r\n\r\nAfter some manipulation he managed to get the bunch between the heels of his mittened hands. In this fashion he carried it to his mouth. The ice crackled and snapped when by a violent effort he opened his mouth. He drew the lower jaw in, curled the upper lip out of the way, and scraped the bunch with his upper teeth in order to separate a match. He succeeded in getting one, which he dropped on his lap. He was no better off. He could not pick it up. Then he devised a way. He picked it up in his teeth and scratched it on his leg. Twenty times he scratched before he succeeded in lighting it. As it flamed he held it with his teeth to the birch-bark. But the burning brimstone went up his nostrils and into his lungs, causing him to cough spasmodically. The match fell into the snow and went out.\r\n\r\nThe old-timer on Sulphur Creek was right, he thought in the moment of controlled despair that ensued: after fifty below, a man should travel with a partner. He beat his hands, but failed in exciting any sensation. Suddenly he bared both hands, removing the mittens with his teeth. He caught the whole bunch between the heels of his hands. His arm-muscles not being frozen enabled him to press the hand-heels tightly against the matches. Then he scratched the bunch along his leg. It flared into flame, seventy sulphur matches at once! There was no wind to blow them out. He kept his head to one side to escape the strangling fumes, and held the blazing bunch to the birch-bark. As he so held it, he became aware of sensation in his hand. His flesh was burning. He could smell it. Deep down below the surface he could feel it. The sensation developed into pain that grew acute. And still he endured it, holding the flame of the matches clumsily to the bark that would not light readily because his own burning hands were in the way, absorbing most of the flame.\r\n\r\nAt last, when he could endure no more, he jerked his hands apart. The blazing matches fell sizzling into the snow, but the birch-bark was alight. He began laying dry grasses and the tiniest twigs on the flame. He could not pick and choose, for he had to lift the fuel between the heels of his hands. Small pieces of rotten wood and green moss clung to the twigs, and he bit them off as well as he could with his teeth. He cherished the flame carefully and awkwardly. It meant life, and it must not perish. The withdrawal of blood from the surface of his body now made him begin to shiver, and he grew more awkward. A large piece of green moss fell squarely on the little fire. He tried to poke it out with his fingers, but his shivering frame made him poke too far, and he disrupted the nucleus of the little fire, the burning grasses and tiny twigs separating and scattering. He tried to poke them together again, but in spite of the tenseness of the effort, his shivering got away with him, and the twigs were hopelessly scattered. Each twig gushed a puff of smoke and went out. The fire-provider had failed. As he looked apathetically about him, his eyes chanced on the dog, sitting across the ruins of the fire from him, in the snow, making restless, hunching movements, slightly lifting one forefoot and then the other, shifting its weight back and forth on them with wistful eagerness.\r\n\r\nThe sight of the dog put a wild idea into his head. He remembered the tale of the man, caught in a blizzard, who killed a steer and crawled inside the carcass, and so was saved. He would kill the dog and bury his hands in the warm body until the numbness went out of them. Then he could build another fire. He spoke to the dog, calling it to him; but in his voice was a strange note of fear that frightened the animal, who had never known the man to speak in such way before. Something was the matter, and its suspicious nature sensed danger,--it knew not what danger but somewhere, somehow, in its brain arose an apprehension of the man. It flattened its ears down at the sound of the man\'s voice, and its restless, hunching movements and the liftings and shiftings of its forefeet became more pronounced but it would not come to the man. He got on his hands and knees and crawled toward the dog. This unusual posture again excited suspicion, and the animal sidled mincingly away.\r\n\r\nThe man sat up in the snow for a moment and struggled for calmness. Then he pulled on his mittens, by means of his teeth, and got upon his feet. He glanced down at first in order to assure himself that he was really standing up, for the absence of sensation in his feet left him unrelated to the earth. His erect position in itself started to drive the webs of suspicion from the dog\'s mind; and when he spoke peremptorily, with the sound of whip-lashes in his voice, the dog rendered its customary allegiance and came to him. As it came within reaching distance, the man lost his control. His arms flashed out to the dog, and he experienced genuine surprise when he discovered that his hands could not clutch, that there was neither bend nor feeling in the lingers. He had forgotten for the moment that they were frozen and that they were freezing more and more. All this happened quickly, and before the animal could get away, he encircled its body with his arms. He sat down in the snow, and in this fashion held the dog, while it snarled and whined and struggled.\r\n\r\nBut it was all he could do, hold its body encircled in his arms and sit there. He realized that he could not kill the dog. There was no way to do it. With his helpless hands he could neither draw nor hold his sheath-knife nor throttle the animal. He released it, and it plunged wildly away, with tail between its legs, and still snarling. It halted forty feet away and surveyed him curiously, with ears sharply pricked forward. The man looked down at his hands in order to locate them, and found them hanging on the ends of his arms. It struck him as curious that one should have to use his eyes in order to find out where his hands were. He began threshing his arms back and forth, beating the mittened hands against his sides. He did this for five minutes, violently, and his heart pumped enough blood up to the surface to put a stop to his shivering. But no sensation was aroused in the hands. He had an impression that they hung like weights on the ends of his arms, but when he tried to run the impression down, he could not find it.\r\n\r\nA certain fear of death, dull and oppressive, came to him. This fear quickly became poignant as he realized that it was no longer a mere matter of freezing his fingers and toes, or of losing his hands and feet, but that it was a matter of life and death with the chances against him. This threw him into a panic, and he turned and ran up the creek-bed along the old, dim trail. The dog joined in behind and kept up with him. He ran blindly, without intention, in fear such as he had never known in his life. Slowly, as he ploughed and floundered through the snow, he began to see things again--the banks of the creek, the old timber-jams, the leafless aspens, and the sky. The running made him feel better. He did not shiver. Maybe, if he ran on, his feet would thaw out; and, anyway, if he ran far enough, he would reach camp and the boys. Without doubt he would lose some fingers and toes and some of his face; but the boys would take care of him, and save the rest of him when he got there. And at the same time there was another thought in his mind that said he would never get to the camp and the boys; that it was too many miles away, that the freezing had too great a start on him, and that he would soon be stiff and dead. This thought he kept in the background and refused to consider. Sometimes it pushed itself forward and demanded to be heard, but he thrust it back and strove to think of other things.\r\n\r\nIt struck him as curious that he could run at all on feet so frozen that he could not feel them when they struck the earth and took the weight of his body. He seemed to himself to skim along above the surface and to have no connection with the earth. Somewhere he had once seen a winged Mercury, and he wondered if Mercury felt as he felt when skimming over the earth.\r\n\r\nHis theory of running until he reached camp and the boys had one flaw in it: he lacked the endurance. Several times he stumbled, and finally he tottered, crumpled up, and fell. When he tried to rise, he failed. He must sit and rest, he decided, and next time he would merely walk and keep on going. As he sat and regained his breath, he noted that he was feeling quite warm and comfortable. He was not shivering, and it even seemed that a warm glow had come to his chest and trunk. And yet, when he touched his nose or cheeks, there was no sensation. Running would not thaw them out. Nor would it thaw out his hands and feet. Then the thought came to him that the frozen portions of his body must be extending. He tried to keep this thought down, to forget it, to think of something else; he was aware of the panicky feeling that it caused, and he was afraid of the panic. But the thought asserted itself, and persisted, until it produced a vision of his body totally frozen. This was too much, and he made another wild run along the trail. Once he slowed down to a walk, but the thought of the freezing extending itself made him run again.\r\n\r\nAnd all the time the dog ran with him, at his heels. When he fell down a second time, it curled its tail over its forefeet and sat in front of him facing him curiously eager and intent. The warmth and security of the animal angered him, and he cursed it till it flattened down its ears appeasingly. This time the shivering came more quickly upon the man. He was losing in his battle with the frost. It was creeping into his body from all sides. The thought of it drove him on, but he ran no more than a hundred feet, when he staggered and pitched headlong. It was his last panic. When he had recovered his breath and control, he sat up and entertained in his mind the conception of meeting death with dignity. However, the conception did not come to him in such terms. His idea of it was that he had been making a fool of himself, running around like a chicken with its head cut off--such was the simile that occurred to him. Well, he was bound to freeze anyway, and he might as well take it decently. With this new-found peace of mind came the first glimmerings of drowsiness. A good idea, he thought, to sleep off to death. It was like taking an anaesthetic. Freezing was not so bad as people thought. There were lots worse ways to die.\r\n\r\nHe pictured the boys finding his body next day. Suddenly he found himself with them, coming along the trail and looking for himself. And, still with them, he came around a turn in the trail and found himself lying in the snow. He did not belong with himself any more, for even then he was out of himself, standing with the boys and looking at himself in the snow. It certainly was cold, was his thought. When he got back to the States he could tell the folks what real cold was. He drifted on from this to a vision of the old-timer on Sulphur Creek. He could see him quite clearly, warm and comfortable, and smoking a pipe.\r\n\r\n\"You were right, old hoss; you were right,\" the man mumbled to the old-timer of Sulphur Creek.\r\n\r\nThen the man drowsed off into what seemed to him the most comfortable and satisfying sleep he had ever known. The dog sat facing him and waiting. The brief day drew to a close in a long, slow twilight. There were no signs of a fire to be made, and, besides, never in the dog\'s experience had it known a man to sit like that in the snow and make no fire. As the twilight drew on, its eager yearning for the fire mastered it, and with a great lifting and shifting of forefeet, it whined softly, then flattened its ears down in anticipation of being chidden by the man. But the man remained silent. Later, the dog whined loudly. And still later it crept close to the man and caught the scent of death. This made the animal bristle and back away. A little longer it delayed, howling under the stars that leaped and danced and shone brightly in the cold sky. Then it turned and trotted up the trail in the direction of the camp it knew, where were the other food-providers and fire-providers.', '\"To Build a Fire\" is a short story by American author Jack London.

(9, 'An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge', 'A man stood upon a railroad bridge in northern Alabama, looking down into the swift water twenty feet below. The man\'s hands were behind his back, the wrists bound with a cord. A rope closely encircled his neck. It was attached to a stout cross-timber above his head and the slack fell to the level of his knees. Some loose boards laid upon the sleepers supporting the metals of the railway supplied a footing for him and his executioners--two private soldiers of the Federal army, directed by a sergeant who in civil life may have been a deputy sheriff. At a short remove upon the same temporary platform was an officer in the uniform of his rank, armed. He was a captain. A sentinel at each end of the bridge stood with his rifle in the position known as \"support,\" that is to say, vertical in front of the left shoulder, the hammer resting on the forearm thrown straight across the chest--a formal and unnatural position, enforcing an erect carriage of the body. It did not appear to be the duty of these two men to know what was occurring at the center of the bridge; they merely blockaded the two ends of the foot planking that traversed it. Beyond one of the sentinels nobody was in sight; the railroad ran straight away into a forest for a hundred yards, then, curving, was lost to view. Doubtless there was an outpost farther along. The other bank of the stream was open ground--a gentle acclivity topped with a stockade of vertical tree trunks, loopholed for rifles, with a single embrasure through which protruded the muzzle of a brass cannon commanding the bridge. Midway of the slope between the bridge and fort were the spectators--a single company of infantry in line, at \"parade rest,\" the butts of the rifles on the ground, the barrels inclining slightly backward against the right shoulder, the hands crossed upon the stock. A lieutenant stood at the right of the line, the point of his sword upon the ground, his left hand resting upon his right. Excepting the group of four at the center of the bridge, not a man moved. The company faced the bridge, staring stonily, motionless. The sentinels, facing the banks of the stream, might have been statues to adorn the bridge. The captain stood with folded arms, silent, observing the work of his subordinates, but making no sign. Death is a dignitary who when he comes announced is to be received with formal manifestations of respect, even by those most familiar with him. In the code of military etiquette silence and fixity are forms of deference.\r\n\r\nAn Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge pendulum with escapementThe man who was engaged in being hanged was apparently about thirty-five years of age. He was a civilian, if one might judge from his habit, which was that of a planter. His features were good--a straight nose, firm mouth, broad forehead, from which his long, dark hair was combed straight back, falling behind his ears to the collar of his well-fitting frock coat. He wore a mustache and pointed beard, but no whiskers; his eyes were large and dark gray, and had a kindly expression which one would hardly have expected in one whose neck was in the hemp. Evidently this was no vulgar assassin. The liberal military code makes provision for hanging many kinds of persons, and gentlemen are not excluded.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nThe preparations being complete, the two private soldiers stepped aside and each drew away the plank upon which he had been standing. The sergeant turned to the captain, saluted and placed himself immediately behind that officer, who in turn moved apart one pace. These movements left the condemned man and the sergeant standing on the two ends of the same plank, which spanned three of the cross-ties of the bridge. The end upon which the civilian stood almost, but not quite, reached a fourth. This plank had been held in place by the weight of the captain; it was now held by that of the sergeant. At a signal from the former the latter would step aside, the plank would tilt and the condemned man go down between two ties. The arrangement commended itself to his judgment as simple and effective. His face had not been covered nor his eyes bandaged. He looked a moment at his \"unsteadfast footing,\" then let his gaze wander to the swirling water of the stream racing madly beneath his feet. A piece of dancing driftwood caught his attention and his eyes followed it down the current. How slowly it appeared to move, What a sluggish stream!\r\n\r\nHe closed his eyes in order to fix his last thoughts upon his wife and children. The water, touched to gold by the early sun, the brooding mists under the banks at some distance down the stream, the fort, the soldiers, the piece of drift--all had distracted him. And now he became conscious of a new disturbance. Striking through the thought of his dear ones was a sound which he could neither ignore nor understand, a sharp, distinct, metallic percussion like the stroke of a blacksmith\'s hammer upon the anvil; it had the same ringing quality. He wondered what it was, and whether immeasurably distant or near by--it seemed both. Its recurrence was regular, but as slow as the tolling of a death knell. He awaited each stroke with impatience and--he knew not why--apprehension. The intervals of silence grew progressively longer, the delays became maddening. With their greater infrequency the sounds increased in strength and sharpness. They hurt his ear like the thrust of a knife; he feared he would shriek. What he heard was the ticking of his watch.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nHe unclosed his eyes and saw again the water below him. \"If I could free my hands,\" he thought, \"I might throw off the noose and spring into the stream. By diving I could evade the bullets and, swimming vigorously, reach the bank, take to the woods and get away home. My home, thank God, is as yet outside their lines; my wife and little ones are still beyond the invader\'s farthest advance.\"\r\n\r\nAs these thoughts, which have here to be set down in words, were flashed into the doomed man\'s brain rather than evolved from it the captain nodded to the sergeant. The sergeant stepped aside.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nAn Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge: Farm HospitalityPeyton Farquhar was a well-to-do planter, of an old and highly respected Alabama family. Being a slave owner and like other slave owners a politician he was naturally an original secessionist and ardently devoted to the Southern cause. Circumstances of an imperious nature, which it is unnecessary to relate here, had prevented him from taking service with the gallant army that had fought the disastrous campaigns ending with the fall of Corinth, and he chafed under the inglorious restraint, longing for the release of his energies, the larger life of the soldier, the opportunity for distinction. That opportunity, he felt, would come, as it comes to all in war time. Meanwhile he did what he could. No service was too humble for him to perform in aid of the South, no adventure too perilous for him to undertake if consistent with the character of a civilian who was at heart a soldier, and who in good faith and without too much qualification assented to at least a part of the frankly villainous dictum that all is fair in love and war.\r\n\r\nOne evening while Farquhar and his wife were sitting on a rustic bench near the entrance to his grounds, a gray-clad soldier rode up to the gate and asked for a drink of water. Mrs. Farquhar was only too happy to serve him with her own white hands. While she was fetching the water her husband approached the dusty horseman and inquired eagerly for news from the front.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\"The Yanks are repairing the railroads,\" said the man, \"and are getting ready for another advance. They have reached the Owl Creek bridge, put it in order and built a stockade on the north bank. The commandant has issued an order, which is posted everywhere, declaring that any civilian caught interfering with the railroad, its bridges, tunnels or trains will be summarily hanged. I saw the order.\"\r\n\r\n\"How far is it to the Owl Creek bridge?\" Farquhar asked.\r\n\r\n\"About thirty miles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there no force on this side the creek?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only a picket post half a mile out, on the railroad, and a single sentinel at this end of the bridge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose a man--a civilian and student of hanging--should elude the picket post and perhaps get the better of the sentinel,\" said Farquhar, smiling, \"what could he accomplish?\"\r\n\r\nThe soldier reflected. \"I was there a month ago,\" he replied. \"I observed that the flood of last winter had lodged a great quantity of driftwood against the wooden pier at this end of the bridge. It is now dry and would burn like tow.\"\r\n\r\nThe lady had now brought the water, which the soldier drank. He thanked her ceremoniously, bowed to her husband and rode away. An hour later, after nightfall, he repassed the plantation, going northward in the direction from which he had come. He was a Federal scout.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAs Peyton Farquhar fell straight downward through the bridge he lost consciousness and was as one already dead. From this state he was awakened--ages later, it seemed to him--by the pain of a sharp pressure upon his throat, followed by a sense of suffocation. Keen, poignant agonies seemed to shoot from his neck downward through every fiber of his body and limbs. These pains appeared to flash along well-defined lines of ramification and to beat with an inconceivably rapid periodicity. They seemed like streams of pulsating fire heating him to an intolerable temperature. As to his head, he was conscious of nothing but a feeling of fulness--of congestion. These sensations were unaccompanied by thought. The intellectual part of his nature was already effaced; he had power only to feel, and feeling was torment. He was conscious of motion. Encompassed in a luminous cloud, of which he was now merely the fiery heart, without material substance, he swung through unthinkable arcs of oscillation, like a vast pendulum. Then all at once, with terrible suddenness, the light about him shot upward with the noise of a loud splash; a frightful roaring was in his ears, and all was cold and dark. The power of thought was restored; he knew that the rope had broken and he had fallen into the stream. There was no additional strangulation; the noose about his neck was already suffocating him and kept the water from his lungs. To die of hanging at the bottom of a river!--the idea seemed to him ludicrous. He opened his eyes in the darkness and saw above him a gleam of light, but how distant, how inaccessible! He was still sinking, for the light became fainter and fainter until it was a mere glimmer. Then it began to grow and brighten, and he knew that he was rising toward the surface--knew it with reluctance, for he was now very comfortable. \"To be hanged and drowned,\" he thought? \"that is not so bad; but I do not wish to be shot. No; I will not be shot; that is not fair.\"\r\n\r\nHe was not conscious of an effort, but a sharp pain in his wrist apprised him that he was trying to free his hands. He gave the struggle his attention, as an idler might observe the feat of a juggler, without interest in the outcome. What splendid effort!--what magnificent, what superhuman strength! Ah, that was a fine endeavor! Bravo! The cord fell away; his arms parted and floated upward, the hands dimly seen on each side in the growing light. He watched them with a new interest as first one and then the other pounced upon the noose at his neck. They tore it away and thrust it fiercely aside, its undulations resembling those of a water snake. \"Put it back, put it back!\" He thought he shouted these words to his hands, for the undoing of the noose had been succeeded by the direst pang that he had yet experienced. His neck ached horribly; his brain was on fire; his heart, which had been fluttering faintly, gave a great leap, trying to force itself out at his mouth. His whole body was racked and wrenched with an insupportable anguish! But his disobedient hands gave no heed to the command. They beat the water vigorously with quick, downward strokes, forcing him to the surface. He felt his head emerge; his eyes were blinded by the sunlight; his chest expanded convulsively, and with a supreme and crowning agony his lungs engulfed a great draught of air, which instantly he expelled in a shriek!\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nHe was now in full possession of his physical senses. They were, indeed, preternaturally keen and alert. Something in the awful disturbance of his organic system had so exalted and refined them that they made record of things never before perceived. He felt the ripples upon his face and heard their separate sounds as they struck. He looked at the forest on the bank of the stream, saw the individual trees, the leaves and the veining of each leaf--saw the very insects upon them: the locusts, the brilliant-bodied flies, the grey spiders stretching their webs from twig to twig. He noted the prismatic colors in all the dewdrops upon a million blades of grass. The humming of the gnats that danced above the eddies of the stream, the beating of the dragon flies\' wings, the strokes of the water-spiders\' legs, like oars which had lifted their boat--all these made audible music. A fish slid along beneath his eyes and he heard the rush of its body parting the water.\r\n\r\nHe had come to the surface facing down the stream; in a moment the visible world seemed to wheel slowly round, himself the pivotal point, and he saw the bridge, the fort, the soldiers upon the bridge, the captain, the sergeant, the two privates, his executioners. They were in silhouette against the blue sky. They shouted and gesticulated, pointing at him. The captain had drawn his pistol, but did not fire; the others were unarmed. Their movements were grotesque and horrible, their forms gigantic.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he heard a sharp report and something struck the water smartly within a few inches of his head, spattering his face with spray. He heard a second report, and saw one of the sentinels with his rifle at his shoulder, a light cloud of blue smoke rising from the muzzle. The man in the water saw the eye of the man on the bridge gazing into his own through the sights of the rifle. He observed that it was a grey eye and remembered having read that grey eyes were keenest, and that all famous marksmen had them. Nevertheless, this one had missed.\r\n\r\nA counter-swirl had caught Farquhar and turned him half round; he was again looking into the forest on the bank opposite the fort. The sound of a clear, high voice in a monotonous singsong now rang out behind him and came across the water with a distinctness that pierced and subdued all other sounds, even the beating of the ripples in his ears. Although no soldier, he had frequented camps enough to know the dread significance of that deliberate, drawling, aspirated chant; the lieutenant on shore was taking a part in the morning\'s work. How coldly and pitilessly--with what an even, calm intonation, presaging, and enforcing tranquillity in the men--with what accurately measured intervals fell those cruel words:\r\n\r\n\"Attention, company! . . Shoulder arms! . . . Ready! . . . Aim! . . . Fire!\"\r\n\r\nFarquhar dived--dived as deeply as he could. The water roared in his ears like the voice of Niagara, yet he heard the dulled thunder of the volley and, rising again toward the surface, met shining bits of metal, singularly flattened, oscillating slowly downward. Some of them touched him on the face and hands, then fell away, continuing their descent. One lodged between his collar and neck; it was uncomfortably warm and he snatched it out.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nAs he rose to the surface, gasping for breath, he saw that he had been a long time under water; he was perceptibly farther down stream nearer to safety. The soldiers had almost finished reloading; the metal ramrods flashed all at once in the sunshine as they were drawn from the barrels, turned in the air, and thrust into their sockets. The two sentinels fired again, independently and ineffectually.\r\n\r\nThe hunted man saw all this over his shoulder; he was now swimming vigorously with the current. His brain was as energetic as his arms and legs; he thought with the rapidity of lightning.\r\n\r\nThe officer,\" he reasoned, \"will not make that martinet\'s error a second time. It is as easy to dodge a volley as a single shot. He has probably already given the command to fire at will. God help me, I cannot dodge them all!\"\r\n\r\nAn appalling splash within two yards of him was followed by a loud, rushing sound, diminuendo, which seemed to travel back through the air to the fort and died in an explosion which stirred the very river to its deeps!\r\n\r\nA rising sheet of water curved over him, fell down upon him, blinded him, strangled him! The cannon had taken a hand in the game. As he shook his head free from the commotion of the smitten water he heard the deflected shot humming through the air ahead, and in an instant it was cracking and smashing the branches in the forest beyond.\r\n\r\n\"They will not do that again,\" he thought; \"the next time they will use a charge of grape. I must keep my eye upon the gun; the smoke will apprise me--the report arrives too late; it lags behind the missile. That is a good gun.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly he felt himself whirled round and round--spinning like a top. The water, the banks, the forests, the now distant bridge, fort and men--all were commingled and blurred. Objects were represented by their colors only; circular horizontal streaks of color--that was all he saw. He had been caught in a vortex and was being whirled on with a velocity of advance and gyration that made him giddy and sick. In a few moments he was flung upon the gravel at the foot of the left bank of the stream--the southern bank--and behind a projecting point which concealed him from his enemies. The sudden arrest of his motion, the abrasion of one of his hands on the gravel, restored him, and he wept with delight. He dug his fingers into the sand, threw it over himself in handfuls and audibly blessed it. It looked like diamonds, rubies, emeralds; he could think of nothing beautiful which it did not resemble. The trees upon the bank were giant garden plants; he noted a definite order in their arrangement, inhaled the fragrance of their blooms. A strange, roseate light shone through the spaces among their trunks and the wind made in their branches the music of olian harps. He had no wish to perfect his escape--was content to remain in that enchanting spot until retaken.\r\n\r\nA whiz and rattle of grapeshot among the branches high above his head roused him from his dream. The baffled cannoneer had fired him a random farewell. He sprang to his feet, rushed up the sloping bank, and plunged into the forest.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nAll that day he traveled, laying his course by the rounding sun. The forest seemed interminable; nowhere did he discover a break in it, not even a woodman\'s road. He had not known that he lived in so wild a region. There was something uncanny in the revelation.\r\n\r\nBy nightfall he was fatigued, footsore, famishing. The thought of his wife and children urged him on. At last he found a road which led him in what he knew to be the right direction. It was as wide and straight as a city street, yet it seemed untraveled. No fields bordered it, no dwelling anywhere. Not so much as the barking of a dog suggested human habitation. The black bodies of the trees formed a straight wall on both sides, terminating on the horizon in a point, like a diagram in a lesson in perspective. Overhead, as he looked up through this rift in the wood, shone great garden stars looking unfamiliar and grouped in strange constellations. He was sure they were arranged in some order which had a secret and malign significance. The wood on either side was full of singular noises, among which--once, twice, and again--he distinctly heard whispers in an unknown tongue.\r\n\r\nHis neck was in pain and lifting his hand to it found it horribly swollen. He knew that it had a circle of black where the rope had bruised it. His eyes felt congested; he could no longer close them. His tongue was swollen with thirst; he relieved its fever by thrusting it forward from between his teeth into the cold air. How softly the turf had carpeted the untraveled avenue--he could no longer feel the roadway beneath his feet!\r\n\r\nDoubtless, despite his suffering, he had fallen asleep while walking, for now he sees another scene--perhaps he has merely recovered from a delirium. He stands at the gate of his own home. All is as he left it, and all bright and beautiful in the morning sunshine. He must have traveled the entire night. As he pushes open the gate and passes up the wide white walk, he sees a flutter of female garments; his wife, looking fresh and cool and sweet, steps down from the veranda to meet him. At the bottom of the steps she stands waiting, with a smile of ineffable joy, an attitude of matchless grace and dignity. Ah, how beautiful she is! He springs forward with extended arms. As he is about to clasp her he feels a stunning blow upon the back of the neck; a blinding white light blazes all about him with a sound like the shock of a cannon--then all is darkness and silence!\r\n\r\nPeyton Farquhar was dead; his body, with a broken neck, swung gently from side to side beneath the timbers of the Owl Creek bridge.', 'Set during the American Civil War, \"An Occurrence at Owl Creek\" is Bierce\'s most famous short story.

(10, 'The First Fire', 'Apparently my father, in his later years, developed a taste for being penetrated rectally by young boys. Not particularly young, I should say, and not plural “boys,” either. For all I can tell, in fact, it was just the one: Timothy Carroll, a seventeen-year-old sophomore who lived around the corner from us and whose older brother Brian had been my classmate at New Dorp High.\r\n\r\nI discovered this the day after my father’s funeral. The service itself was what I’d expected, the baking hot synagogue dotted with temple old-timers, a couple of unanticipated and ancient second cousins, my dad’s engineering contemporaries from over at the institute, and lots of my mom’s friends. We drove out to Baron Hirsh Cemetery in a solemn line, lit headlights brown in the bright summer sun, and laid the man next to his mother and father in a plot that no one in my immediate family had seen since my grandmother’s burial twelve years earlier. It was the only time I’ve ever ridden in a limo. I wore my one suit.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon the traditional hard-boiled eggs and lentils sat untouched next to the more popular non-secular items: the onion dip, the almond cake, the quiche. Everyone had coffee in our den, my mother sitting on the couch in a black Chinese cheongsam-style dress, flinching visibly at every piece of cemetery dirt tracked across our beige carpet by my father’s oblivious colleagues. It had been one of my mother’s rules, strictly enforced since the new carpet was laid fifteen years before: Shoes Off Immediately Upon Entry. My mother knew she couldn’t insist on this rule now, and that was probably the worst part of the whole thing for her. She’d have to rent a steam vac.\r\n\r\nFor me, putting my rubber soles down on the thick plush for the first time was almost erotic, a little electric thrill running through me when I thought my mother might see and be unable to comment, if only for propriety’s sake. Soon though, shame creeping up on me, I took my shoes off anyway, then brought her a refill of coffee that was mostly just Kahlua. After tasting it, she looked up at me gratefully.\r\n\r\nDuring my third whiskey I stumbled to my dad’s stereo and put on Casals doing Bach’s Cello Suites, even though there wasn’t supposed to be any music. The rough-hewn cello felt like autumn, all papered leaves and the peace of being inside while a wind might twist against the windows. The music was out of place in the dead summer air, but still, it was my father’s favorite, and that seemed appropriate.\r\n\r\nWhen the service was over, the guests gone, my mother immediately set to straightening up the house. Still in her dress, her teeth clenched, she attacked the floor on hands and knees with carpet spray and sponge as viciously as if she were sanding wood, only looking up occasionally to reach for her drink. Without saying a word, I put all the dirty dishes into the sink, then went upstairs, hung my suit and fell asleep naked in the overwhelming heat.\r\n\r\nThe next day was even hotter, and I woke up late and drenched in sweat, my head and tongue heavy from the day before’s whiskey. Downstairs, my mother told me her friends were coming over for lunch. After coffee I went to clean up, but she was already in the bathroom putting on her makeup and fixing her hair. So I went to the basement to use the shower there.\r\n\r\nI hadn’t been down the rubber-lined stairs in years. As a kid the basement, all spider-webbed corners, was too scary to spend any time in, and if my parents told me to go and get a spare light bulb I’d plead with them not to make me. My father would send me anyway, telling me not to be such a baby. I’d be terrified, and when I’d finally find the bulbs I would turn and run back upstairs as fast as I could, sure that I was being chased by whatever monsters lived there.\r\n\r\nBut when I got to high school the basement became more appealing. I set up my own den, complete with an old couch, a TV, Nintendo. During summers my father spent every day in his air-conditioned office, so of course it was fine if we were the only family on the block without an AC at home. The cellar was the coolest part of the house, there was a bathroom and a shower, and I’d only come upstairs for the meals my mother wouldn’t allow me to bring down. The basement was private, and I felt like it was mine. I would play music loud and stay up as late as I wanted, and my few friends and I would sneak down beer when we could get some, would smoke weed by the high window without concern of getting caught. Sometimes, late at night, I still got scared. Sure that each creak of the house’s foundation was actually an intruder, I’d bolt awake on the couch, my eyes wide and searching in the particled dark. But I wouldn’t let myself go upstairs, instead whispering baby at myself until I fell asleep again.\r\n\r\nI guess in the last six years my father had figured out the virtues of having one’s own dark space. What was once my clubhouse had been taken over: the couch, the TV, all of my band posters were gone, replaced by a huge raw-wood table that held an intricate scale model of all of Staten Island, including the beginnings of a detailed version of our town. The bay was thick, gray, translucent polyurethane, and there were small train tracks emerging from a tunnel near the Narrows. The tracks circled the island, then rose up onto a bridge near the Goethels. There they dipped into a tunnel and looped all the way around under the table and back to the Narrows. The layout was obviously in a state of construction: hills were only curves of tight metal screen, tracks ended abruptly, whole stretches were just outlines and measurements in soft pencil. There was a worktable nearby and several trains in various stages of completion, sheets of tin and tiny motors, a soldering iron and an air-brush. And, drawn in my father’s immaculate hand on a piece of graph paper, the plans for a model of our house.\r\n\r\nThe detail of the whole thing, the time my father had spent obsessing over it, indeed the presence of the dead man in everything on the table creeped me out. I could see him here, his back beginning to bend with age, his hair graying, in a sweater against the winter chill, working alone late at night. Muttering to himself, as he always did. I felt like I had walked in on him, on something secret, or like he was watching me then, was still there. Suddenly the basement seemed quite cold, and I headed quickly to the shower.\r\n\r\nMy father didn’t have the clean bug like my mom, and I guess she’d left this bathroom to him. Unlike his work space, where every tool was in its outlined place on the wall or in a drawer, the bathroom was chaos. There were crusty-stiff hand towels everywhere, bars of dirty soap and greasy cans of acetone and Goop hand cleaner. The tap smelled of sulfur. When I pulled the moldy shower curtain aside I had to cover my nose. It was clear he hadn’t used the shower to bathe in a long time; it was covered in a thick film of slime, and there was a mop and bucket on the floor that was full of murky brown water that smelled so bad it made me gag. I took the bucket out and dumped the water in the laundry sink. At the bottom was a swollen and half-decomposed mouse.\r\n\r\nI could have gone upstairs then, should have called it quits and whined at my mother until she got out of the bathroom. It wouldn’t have been the first time. But I didn’t. I don’t know if it was guilt about the shoes on the carpet the day before, or knowing how upset she would be if she found out about the mess, but I was going to have to clean it up, and an anger bloomed inside of me right then. An anger at my father for having left it like this, for letting the mess get this bad in the first place.\r\n\r\nI went and opened the small cubby next to the toilet in search of cleaning supplies. Sitting there, neatly stacked on the unfinished concrete, was a bundle of my father’s magazines: Edmund’s Scientific catalogues,National Geographic, and years’ worth of Model Railroader. When I pulled out the big pile I found another, different stack, this one bound in bunny-ears-tied string and made up of unlabelled, green file folders.\r\n\r\nMy chest got tight, a lump crawling up my throat as I opened the top folder and noticed the first pictures. A different sort of catalogue entirely, there were pages and pages of glossy magazine spreads, all cut precisely with an Xacto knife, all featuring the kind of pictures you’d see in Abercrombie & Fitch advertisements. There were maybe ten or fifteen shots, and every one of them featured young men with perfect hair: at the beach, in a park, playing football or splashing in the ocean. Some were muddy, others drenched so what clothes they had on stuck to their slick, beefy bodies. The dirty football players had their arms around each other, or were leaping and tackling, shirts raised in action and exposing cut six-pack abs. In the ocean they were mostly shirtless, bare chests shaved, bathing suits hung so low you could make out the top of what was clearly well-groomed pubic hair. None of them had any heads. They had all been neatly cut off, cropped in a line across the top of the whole photo, so that only thick bodies remained, frolicking in the scene below.\r\n\r\nI shut the folder and closed my eyes as a tremor of shock passed through my body. I wanted a cigarette. I wanted a drink. Mostly I wanted to not be in the basement anymore. I wanted to be far away, to not have to be dealing with any of it: my father’s death, my mother’s tight-lipped grief, the heat of the house and the stifling air of Staten Island.\r\n\r\nBut I didn’t leave, didn’t get up and go get a drink or go out into the sunny day. I couldn’t: these folders were, in a sense, part of my father’s estate, and somewhere deep down I needed to know just exactly what that estate was.\r\n\r\nThe pictures only got worse. In the next folder the boys were almost fully nude, stretched across the page displaying impossibly inflated groins tucked into ultra-tight underwear. In many of these my father hadn’t even had to crop the photos. The advertisements were just of the bodies: faultless, always muscular, without birth mark or body hair.\r\n\r\nI felt ashamed. Simply to be looking at the photos, at the maleness of them, but then also, clearly, I felt ashamed by the implication. I could not figure out what they might be doing in my father’s private bathroom, couldn’t synchronize the content of them with any idea I had of the old man. My mind raced in search of possibilities other than the obvious one, but none would quite come.\r\n\r\nBut if I couldn’t figure out what exactly these photos meant about my conception of my father, as I scanned the other files it became undeniable. Each folder seemed to be divided into theme, my father’s engineering instincts present even here. The models got younger, the pictures more provocative. Boys that weren’t out of high school, their bodies still gawky arms and undeveloped chests, stood in white jocks around what looked like a locker room bench, or were lifting barbells in a weight room, or were wrestling on a gym floor. Underwear became no underwear, these weren’t advertisements anymore, the quality got worse, the lighting rough and the exposure poor, and in the last folder there were older men in the pictures, too. Hairy and overweight, their faces also out of frame, their pale bodies wrapped basely around the boys’ perfect limbs.\r\n\r\nI sat, stunned, on the bathroom floor. The pile of folders lay haphazardly in my lap, spilled in a heap. And then, peeking out of one, something I hadn’t noticed when I was flipping through them: a notebook. It was thick and coverless, was of the yellow, lined paper my father preferred, and in fact looked exactly like any of a number of pads that were still scattered around the house. The pages were covered in script, the perfect almost-print of my father’s mechanical pencil. I picked it up and started reading.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nOnly one memory I had of my father seemed relevant to his keeping this journal. When I was in the fifth grade I got caught having scribbled “Amanda Ackerman is a fat cow” in Amanda Ackerman’s end-of-the-year signature book. My teacher, Miss Stückhausen, immediately yanked me out of the classroom by my hair and sent me to the office of our principal, Mr. Wang. Mr. Wang called my parents, and soon thereafter my father arrived.\r\n\r\nNormally, it would have been my mother who came to school. I’m not sure where she was that day, but the burden had fallen on my father, a man whose temper was lightning quick and equally unfathomable to a young boy, and who also had a proclivity toward a more painful brand of corporal punishment than my mother. The result was that I was terrified, my chest hitching from recent tears and anticipated new ones. At the meeting my father was unreadable, sitting patiently while Mr. Wang showed him the vandalized book and explained how it was something Amanda had been meant to treasure forever as a souvenir of her time at PS 41. He said nothing to me for the entire car ride home. I sat paralyzed by fear, sure that his silence and calm demeanor hid a rage too great to be expressed in public but which, in the privacy of home, would prove apocalyptic.\r\n\r\nBut at the end of that silent car trip, when we pulled up to our house, my father simply sat there, staring through the windshield at the empty street as the car idled. Finally, he turned to me, smile and grimace sharing his face equally, and said only, “Never write it down. If you write it down, they have proof.” When he reached across my lap I flinched, but he just opened my door and sent me alone into the house.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, he had apparently done just that: he had written it down. In the notebook, in excruciating detail, each entry time-stamped and dated and laid out in his precise script. I went through it all. How he had berated himself for his feelings, cursed himself, then tried to figure out exactly what it was that was going through his head. The words were passionate, more excitable and emotional than I could ever remember him being. He fought with himself, argued with himself, hated himself, and, in the end, just a few weeks before his death, he gave in.\r\n\r\nAccording to my father’s journal, this spring my mother had hired Timothy Carroll to do some work around the house. I had never really liked the Carroll brothers. When they moved to the neighborhood from Canada with their pickup truck and torn street hockey net I pegged them pretty quickly as thugs-in-the-making. Brian was fourteen then, Timmy was eight, and their father had owned a chain of gas stations in Ottawa. It was rumored he had had to leave Canada fast after some shady dealings with a supplier, though how anyone in our town would have known that is beyond me. Despite my reservations I made a go of it with Brian. The Carrolls had a broken-down trike in their driveway, and the idea that they might get it up and running was enough to keep me hanging out with him for a summer or so. It became clear soon enough that the trike was never going to get moving, and my friendship with Brian likewise stalled pretty quickly after that.\r\n\r\nBrian and Timothy Carroll weren’t exactly the brightest kids. Brian had a deep, slow voice, like his tongue was too big for his mouth, and, for example, just couldn’t figure it out when our JV soccer team was learning the Offside Trap. It didn’t help that he would soon spend a lot of time in the weight room, was growing quickly thick and tall, and also had the advantage of being the new kid in town. The girls at school were into him and he played it up, acting tough and dumb. I couldn’t believe how much they loved his act, and the more they did the more annoyed I grew.\r\n\r\nHis brother looked just like him, but in miniature. I was in high school, Timothy was only in elementary school, but I could already envision him in a couple of years in a baseball cap and button down getting drunk on canned beer and whiskey and getting in fights at parties on the baseball field near our houses late at night. Really, what I could already see back then was Timothy Carroll in a baseball cap and Abercrombie & Fitch button down, in a pack of similarly dressed friends, walking around like they owned wherever it was they were, wrestling with each other, being loud and playing football at the beach and kicking sand on people without even knowing it.\r\n\r\nAnd I guess my father saw that too. His notes start light, seeing the kid Ellen hired to clean the gutters. And yet I know of no other example of my father writing down his thoughts about anything that wasn’t job related. Grocery lists, a quick diagram about some project at work, all only occasionally. Never once his thoughts. And even here there was no context for it, just a few lines about the work he was thinking of doing on the house this summer, that he might need some help, that maybe he would ask “the kid.” Aside from the fact that my father never did work on the house during the summers or any other season, even if he was planning to I couldn’t imagine why he would write down who he might possibly hire to help. Did he know why he was doing it? At this early stage? Was he providing cover for himself, without really knowing yet what he was covering up for?\r\n\r\nThe gutters took a full two weeks, and soon the pretense for my father’s notes disappeared. He described coming up from the basement and bumping into Timothy in the kitchen. My mother wasn’t there, but Timothy was helping himself to a glass of water against the spring heat. They talked for a moment, my father noting with surprise that Timothy had a brother who was in my class. It had been six years, but I would be surprised if my father had ever known about Brian, that we had been momentary friends. Hell, I would be surprised if he had even known the Carrolls lived in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nMy father left Timothy and returned to the basement, but the seed had been planted. He wrote here a clear description of Timothy that day: dirt streaked across his forehead, he was sweating through his white t-shirt, was wearing work boots and camo shorts in the pockets of which he had stuck his dirty work gloves. My father didn’t notice that Timothy wasn’t the sharpest stone, he noticed that he was strong, tan, a fine young man. That’s what he wrote. A fine young man. As if he was trying to convince somebody. Or as if he was trying to convince himself.\r\n\r\nThe situation progressed. My father greeted Timothy in the mornings, watched him drag his ladder and buckets around the yard while reading the morning paper in the back room. He wrote out the little dialogue they exchanged each day, had a code in the corner of each entry that indicated which of three or four t-shirts and three pairs of shorts (c.d. for his cutoff denim jeans, w.t. for his dirty white tennis shorts, and m.c. for the camos: military cargo) Timothy had on that day, whether he was wearing work boots or sneakers, each observation made offhand and as if it related to this grand work of cleaning the gutters, or couched in the supposed plans my father had for the house.\r\n\r\nWhen the gutters were finished my father suggested my mother get Timothy to paint the shutters, something she had been asking him to have done for perhaps a decade. When they were painted, he thought maybe they should start doing some landscaping. In the heat of early summer, Timothy would sometimes work shirtless, and my father stopped waiting for him to come inside for water. He brought out cold soda, a towel to wipe his sweat; he told Timothy to take a break, get out of the heat. While my mother was out with her friends, usually playing golf, my father started working from home more and more. He began to ask Timothy to come in for lunch, and soon he’d offer the seventeen-year-old beer.\r\n\r\nAs to whether Timothy himself thought any of these gestures might be a little strange, I didn’t have any idea. It was hard to imagine he didn’t, but my father’s notes, though detailed, were brief. For one day he wrote only,T.C. sullen today. Another was in all-caps: t silent. wrong??!! Aside from these and other brief descriptions, and my father’s often palpable disappointment surrounding the shorter entries, there weren’t many clues to what was really going on between the two during these beginning stages. For all I could tell, things moved forward amiably enough. My father talked sports with him, snuck him a beer or a nip of Sambucca, fed him turkey sandwiches at lunchtime.\r\n\r\nThe work, however, began to run out. The gutters were clean, the shutters painted, the lawn in immaculate shape, seeded and fertilized and fed. The driveway was sealed thick and black, the smell of tar and sun wafting through the neighborhood. Our house looked better than it had in years and there was, simply, little more for a not-so-bright boy of seventeen to do. The siding might need replacement, the roof re-slating, but any of those jobs would take men, not a single boy.\r\n\r\nA panicked edge crept into the notepad here, as my father scrambled to think of small projects Timothy could do. He wrote out a list of them, and soon there was a new band of forsythia limp and out of place around our lamppost; impatiens appeared around the path that led to the front door; sunflowers lined our wooden fence. The house was being dressed like a recent divorcée at a temple mixer.\r\n\r\nAnd then everything on my father’s list was checked off. The week of July 4th my father’s despair was apparent: the Carrolls had gone away for their summer vacation, Timothy went with them, and the journal was almost completely bare. There was only the one entry for the entire week, the pencil pressed deeply into the page: 4 July 2003, 7 am. car packed for belmar. no sign. And then, somewhat quizzically placed by itself a couple of lines farther down: stop.\r\n\r\nThough that last word sat there on the page like a plea, though it was a clear sign, to me at least, that my father knew that what he was doing was wrong, he didn’t stop. It was as if his desire was a rock falling down a mountainside; once that initial slip, he was no longer in control, no matter the damage caused. As long as fate kept the possibility of encounter open, my father would have no choice but to watch it play out. And there was one more time he could count on seeing Timothy again. In the notebook he wrote how he had yet to pay Timothy for the last bit of work he had done, and certainly the boy wouldn’t let that slide. My father knew that, and he used the Carrolls’ vacation week to think about his next move. So when they returned and Timothy came to get paid, my father had ready an array of things to talk about to try to catch his interest.\r\n\r\nSunday afternoon, overcast, humid, my father wrote. My mother had, as usual, gone to play golf (or, if it rained, sit in the 19th hole sipping sombreros and eating grilled chicken Caesar salads with her friends), leaving my father alone in the house. He worked on his computer in the living room, keeping an eye through the front windows just in case Timothy happened to come by, and soon enough that’s exactly what happened. My father’s heart began thumping solid in his chest when he saw the top of Timothy’s head pass on the sidewalk outside, heard his boots on the steps there. He jumped up and met him at the door. Invited him in. He was, as he put it in the journal, shaking with nerves. Felt like a kid at a recital.\r\n\r\nAlthough he knew that Timothy was there to get paid, he didn’t bring it up. He tried instead to make conversation, but he found it difficult to talk, the words coming out of his mouth sounding like nonsense even to him. He ticked off the subjects he had come up with, peppering Timothy with questions about the Carrolls’ vacation (It was fun, Timothy learned how to wakeboard), about the Yankees’ third-base situation (Timothy was more of a hockey fan, he knew that, why hadn’t he read up on the Rangers’ draft?), about the rest of his summer plans (Find a job, hang out with his friends.)\r\n\r\nSoon my father had exhausted all of his pre-planned conversation topics. The two stood there in the foyer then—awkward—as my father’s mind raced through possible new threads, quickly trying out and discarding as stupid one idea after another. Eventually Timothy brought up the money, and my father went and got it for him. He counted out the cash as slowly as he could, hoping still to think of something else to say, anything that would keep Timothy in the house for just a few minutes longer. But he couldn’t. Instead, he walked Timothy back to the door, all the while growing dejected inside. He handed Timothy the cash, tipped him nearly 100% of the total, and thanked him for all the work. Timothy thanked him back, and that was it. There was nothing left. They stood silently for a moment in the doorway, my father fairly certain this would be the last time they would be that close. A flush of resignation filled him both with a relief that he hadn’t done something irrevocable, and a misery at just how strongly he wanted to. He felt defeated, but more than anything, he wrote, he felt small.\r\n\r\nAs the screen door began to close behind the younger Carroll, one last idea blossomed in my father’s head. This last thought seemed suddenly obvious to him, though as he spoke the words they, too, seemed to him to be silly, to reveal the situation for what it was: an old man courting a young boy. He knew inside that it was a last, desperate gasp, but with no other way to make Carroll stay he blurt it out anyway. “Hey, Timothy,” my father said. “Did I ever show you my trains? They’re pretty neat. I have this whole layout in the basement. All of Staten Island’s down there. It’s not done yet, but it’s pretty cool. Do you want to have a look?”\r\n\r\nAnd if Timothy Carroll looked and sounded just like his older brother Brian, if soon enough he would reveal himself to be just as much of a punk, my father had struck upon the one way in which the two brothers differed. It was a secret place held deeply within Timothy, and of which he was equally deeply ashamed. Because, despite his thick head, his thickening body and hands, Timothy Carroll loved all things miniature. Matchbox cars, toy soldiers, model airplanes: though he knew he was much too old for any of them, though his older brother and father had teased him mercilessly about them when they found him still playing with them the last year, had told him that “only girls played with dolls,” had called him “fag” and “queer,” and though he had struck his brother then, had wrestled with Brian until the stronger, older brother had pinned him, had sat above him and taunted him in falsetto before letting a slow loogie fall toward his face, so that he had soon after cached his shoe-box collections under the eaves of the Carrolls’ attic, still Timothy couldn’t resist the pull of the world represented in the tiny, detailed copies.\r\n\r\nAt least this is what he told my father as they wound their way through the house toward the basement. Timothy was enthralled by the trains. He watched them circling, his eyes bright, and soon enough he asked my father if he could conduct them. My father stood behind him, took his hand and placed it on the controller. As the two guided the trains together, Timothy’s hand under my father’s, my father could hardly breathe. When he did, the smell of Timothy’s skin made him weak-kneed. He grew excited, physically, and told Timothy to crouch down to see the trains coming and going at eye level, told him they would appear to be life-size then. And as Timothy followed his instruction, all the while allowing my father’s hand to continue holding his at the controller, my father crouched next to him, pointing at the train’s headlight as it came around a not-yet-built mountain and toward them in New Dorp. They stood at the station, and as the train roared by Timothy leaned back away from it, and my father pressed his body against his, fully.\r\n\r\nScared. That’s how my father described how he was feeling. But if he had no idea how to proceed, Timothy certainly did. For a boy my father considered some kind of ideal innocent, he definitely knew how to take control. Timothy separated himself from my father, stood up, and turned around. Then he began to undress. My father was overwhelmed; he could barely look at Timothy, though when he did what he saw was angelic, milky pale,and incredibly new.\r\n\r\nTimothy wasn’t exactly gentle with him. My father’s journal, though generally restrained as concerned the details of the actual sex, made that much clear. At one point my father had to grope blindly for the train table for support, only to slip, tearing away his model of the New Dorp Light House.\r\n\r\nRegardless, it was soon over, both of them sweating and panting half-naked on the basement’s rough carpet as the trains continued to whiz around the tracks above their heads. And then something strange happened. My father, who I had not once in my life seen come even close to crying, began to weep. He tried to stop himself, pressed on his eyes with his fingers, but he couldn’t hold the tears back. They sprung up from his chest as a tightness that pressed through his whole body, and soon he was shaking with sobs. He wept for what he had done, for what he now undeniably was, and also for the beauty and horror of the dream fulfilled.\r\n\r\nWhich of course freaked Timothy out. Blotches of blush spread across his bare, hairless chest and up through his neck to his cheeks. My father didn’t know what to say, could barely speak, but when Timothy stood up, quickly pulled up his pants and began to leave, he tried to stop him. Timothy got angry then, shoved my father back down to the floor, yelled out only, “I didn’t want to!” and ran up the stairs and out of the house. My father stayed where he was, his wet eyes closed tight and his head buried in his hands.\r\n\r\nThe first few days after that my father was wracked by a guilt far worse than any he had experienced before. He couldn’t sleep, couldn’t eat, was tortured by the reality of what he had done. I wondered, too, if more than anything he was heartbroken. The notes he wrote during that time bear more than a little resemblance to ones I could remember writing to girls who broke up with me in Middle School. His were increasingly frantic, often written late at night in a hand that began less and less to resemble the neat print of the man I knew. Two in particular gave an indication of how he was feeling: on Tuesday, 8 July, at 3:15 a.m., he wrote the word stupidover and over again across two and a half pages. There was nothing from the day of the eighth, but that night, 9 July, at 2:20 a.m., there was an entry that contains just one word as well, though this time written only once, centered and underlined on the first line of the page: why?\r\n\r\nOn July 11th there was a knock on the front door of our house during dinner. My mother started up from the table, but my father, coming alive for the first time in days, suddenly realized who it might be. Panicking, he sat my mother down. “I’ll get it,” he said, and nearly ran toward the front of the house. Timothy Carroll was standing there, and before my father could speak Timothy looked at him hard and said, “I want fifty bucks.”\r\n\r\nMy father knew immediately what was going on. Still, like a wishful lover, he held out hope. He invited Timothy in, asked if he wanted to join my mother and him for dinner. Timothy didn’t decline, didn’t come in, didn’t say anything except to repeat his demand. “Fifty bucks,” he said, and then added, just so there would be no confusion, “or I’ll tell.”\r\n\r\n“Fine, Timothy,” my father said. “Okay.” He walked back through the living room, past my mother’s questioning face in the dining room and into the kitchen, where his wallet was. In which he only had about ten bucks. He started looking through my mother’s purse, digging through it in search of her wallet, when she came into the kitchen demanding to know what he was doing. He told her that he had underpaid the Carroll kid, but that he was short now. If my mother recognized the alarm on his face, the way he wouldn’t look at her as he rifled through her wallet until he had enough money, she didn’t say anything to him. They had lived together for thirty-five years in that house; I couldn’t imagine she didn’t see something there. But if she did, she ignored it and went back to the dinner table while my father went to the front door and handed over the wrinkled bills. He tried again to talk to Timothy, caught his eye once more as the money exchanged hands, half-whispered “Timothy…,” but Carroll gave him nothing in return. He snatched the money, then turned and walked away, his head down.\r\n\r\nA week later, Timothy returned and the scene was repeated. My father felt trapped; he felt like he deserved what he was getting, and at the same time he wanted to see Timothy badly enough that even the extortion was, in a way, a relief. At first Timothy’s demands consisted only of money. But soon they morphed into the small-minded dreams of a seventeen-year-old: a case of beer, a carton of cigarettes, a pair of roller-blades. Then they got more extravagant. First it was a fancy cell-phone, then a Sony PlayStation, then a video camera. Finally, as if he knew what it would do to my father, Timothy demanded a new Ford Mustang.\r\n\r\nOf course, my father could afford none of these more expensive things without drawing the attention of my mother. The journal’s final entry is a simple note stating the obvious: that it was over. That everything was. Both the life that he had led, his job, perhaps his marriage, and also the impossible dream of a relationship with Timothy that he still held in a secret room in his heart. He couldn’t imagine a way out of the situation and so would have to do something serious. Leave town, or go and talk to Timothy’s parents. He would have to tell my mother. My father despaired at the thought of it, but one thing he didn’t do, not anywhere in that last note, was assign blame. He never got angry at Timothy for his outlandish demands, or his stupidity in not understanding what they would mean for the both of them. He expressed only regret: that he had allowed himself to take his fantasy too far, that he had had it at all. He wished more than anything to be back in that before-time, when he could sit calmly at his workshop table and detail the paint on a mountain or house treatment without being tortured by his new love.\r\n\r\nThough the journal doesn’t continue after that my mother told me what happened next. The night of that last note she cooked a dinner of Cajun-style catfish grilled on their George Foreman, baked beans and salad, which they ate in relative silence. My father watched the Yankees lose an 8-0 shutout to the Toronto Blue Jays, snacked on popcorn, got ready for bed like it was any other night. As he got changed he complained of heart burn to my mother, but she told him it was probably just the beans.\r\n\r\nAt around 3:30 a.m. my mother awoke, startled. My father was sitting up in bed, had one hand pledge-of-allegiance-style over his heart while the other pressed hard into her thigh. His eyes were staring at a point far beyond the bedroom wall. “I’m sorry,” he said to no one, and then lay back fully. My mother pulled a pillow over her head, cursed him, and fell back asleep. When she woke the next morning, he was dead.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\n “What are you doing?” my mother said, turning into the bathroom. I had been sitting there in a daze, and I guess I hadn’t heard her on the basement stairs. I was startled and immediately jumped up and started collecting all of the files and papers, trying to hide them from her.\r\n\r\n“What are those?” she demanded.\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” I said. “It’s nothing.” She wasn’t having it. She went right for the notepad, and before I could figure out if I even wanted to stop her from seeing what my father had written, the pad was in her hands. I stood silently aside as she flipped through the pages. Her face was steady, showing no emotion as her eyes scanned them. She didn’t take long. When she was done she looked up at me, sighed, and said, “He promised me he hadn’t done anything about it.” She looked down at the floor, then back at me. “He told me that he wouldn’t. That he never would.”\r\n\r\nShe was angry. Her face was pinched, her jaw tightly set. “What are we going to do,” she asked.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” I said. But I did know. I knew right away. I took the notebook back from her, gathered up all of the files, and started upstairs. Out in the backyard, the big grill was a mess. That, too, my father would never clean when he was finished with it, this man who had told me, over and over again, that “a job isn’t finished until you’ve cleaned it up.” Until I had, it seemed he meant. I lifted the grill cover, the metal surface, and laid the pages down where the charcoal went. I dowsed them in lighter fluid, drew a match, and set it ablaze.\r\n\r\nMy mother came upstairs and watched for a moment, then went into the house and prepared for the arrival of her friends coming to sit shiva with her. When the doorbell announced their presence, I covered the still-burning ashes, washed up, and ate lunch with them. As if nothing had happened at all.\r\n\r\nAnd I want to say right now that I believe in my heart that my father was a good person. I remember when I was little we’d play catch in our backyard. My father would pretend that I was the Yankee great Ron Guidry. I would be pitching to him, it was always the ninth inning, the Bombers up by one, and Kansas City had a guy on second and nobody out. We’d go through each Royals batter, my dad knew them all, and I’d pitch while he would call balls and strikes, make catchers’ signs, would sometimes, if the situation got particularly tight, become Billy Martin sauntering up to the mound for a conference. The Royals would swing, they would miss, or they’d connect for a pop-up high in the trees and I’d be Sweet Lou in left running to make the catch; or it’d be a bouncing grounder that I, as Bucky Dent, would have to scoop and throw to Chambliss, my father, at first.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean is, he was a good father. He was the best father he could be. And if things changed between us sometime around my twelfth birthday, if for some reason I didn’t understand we grew so distant we hardly talked, became the opposite of the best friends we had been, that doesn’t take those other times, those good memories, away.\r\n\r\nAnd I wonder, too, if the overwhelming feeling that I had in that bathroom, after reading the notepad, wasn’t jealousy. Because of how close we used to be, and how distant we had, by that point, become. I had thought that it was his fault, that I was wrong about our original closeness and that in fact my father just wasn’t an emotional person, just wasn’t connected, and therefore wasn’t connected to me. Or that he was disappointed in the way I had turned out. He didn’t understand me, I assumed, and wasn’t the kind of man to allow emotion to press him forward regarding me. And yet here was undeniable proof that he was emotional, that he could be very much invested in someone, or something. And I remember when I was little, I remember him doing this over and over again, this is the memory that brings me closest to actually feeling something about any of this, about his death, about the notepad, about the loss of him in my life: I remember him putting his hand on my cheek, under my ear, cupping my face and saying, “Marcus, I wouldn’t trade you for any other son in the world.”', 'David Andrew Stoler is an award-winning journalist whose work has appeared in alternative weeklies across the country.

He wants strands when it is finished.\r\n\r\nAvery turns, her hair still imprisoned by his hand. She vomits onto his face, the pumpkin insides dripping from his eyes and nose.

(12, 'When Snow Falls on Atlantic City', 'Her feet were cold. He had clutched the comforter tight in his hands and rolled away from her, leaving her toes exposed in the cold morning air. It was still dark when she placed those toes on the wooden floor and wiggled them slowly in an attempt to warm them. She grunted and stood.\r\n\r\nShe placed her feet into the slippers he bought her, took the faded green terry-clothe robe from the hook on the door and put it on. The slippers covered only the front of the foot and were nothing more than thin pieces of cardboard lined with imitation rabbit fur. She walked to the bathroom, pulled the small metal chain and looked in the mirror. She didn’t bother to brush her teeth or wash her face.\r\n\r\nDownstairs she turned on the large bread ovens in the back and the large espresso machine in the front. Through the storefront window she could see the old men driving their rusted trucks, piled high with Jersey fruit, to their stalls along the Italian Market. The stalls were made of rotted planks of wood bolted to metal frames with ancient wheels. Even though the stalls had wheels they hadn’t moved for over thirty years. It was late winter and despite the frost in the air she could still smell the decaying fruit and rotting fish left in the gutter.\r\n\r\nShe was old and Yugoslavian, if there was such a nationality anymore. Even if it still existed she had not been Yugoslavian since she was sixteen and married her husband. He was Italian and she learned how to speak Italian and how to cook pasta and cream sauce instead of stuffed sauerkraut leaves. She had become so much of an Italian that no one in the market ever suspected her of being anything but Italian, even when she told them she had been born in Ljubljana. They said she cooked bread like someone from Bologna, made a cup of espresso like someone from Naples. What did they know? Did they think that only a person from the very loins of Romulus and Remelus could measure yeast and taste just the right amount of salt? Could only someone whose family had survived the explosion of Vesuvius know how to make a perfect cup of coffee? Her Slavic background was her secret, the thing she kept hidden, and the proof of their ignorance.\r\n\r\nEven her husband seemed to forget that she was once something else. He did not know that sixteen years was plenty of time to form ideas and dreams of what life could be like, even though she could no longer remember what they were.\r\n\r\nWhen the espresso machine was fully heated she packed the metal filter with coffee grounds and slipped it into the machine. She heard it hiss and watched the black liquid drip into the tiny cup. She put in two full spoons of sugar and drank it down in a single sip. She took a cigarette from the crumpled pack in the front pocket of the robe, lit it and stared out the front window. The sun was coming up behind gray clouds and she wished she had more coffee. She looked back at the small dirty cup on the counter and it suddenly looked ridiculous. American coffee seemed so much more practical. But her husband wouldn’t hear of it, even though he was the one who insisted on coming to America.\r\n\r\nThe two of them ran a bakery and coffee shop near the south end of the market. They sold bread, espresso and cappuccino. She had tried to get him to sell pastries as well, but he said that bread and coffee was enough. He said they had to specialize. Everyone in the market specialized. They couldn’t just sell meat. It had to be beef, pork, fish or poultry. And now that they had all specialized few people shopped in the Italian Market anymore. Why would they when they could get everything they needed from a single grocery store that offered two for one coupons? Even she shopped under the fluorescent lights of the neighborhood Acme once every two weeks.\r\n\r\nThey had come to America shortly after they had been married. She had gone from Yugoslavian, to Italian, to Yugoslavian-Italian-American, all before her eighteenth birthday. The boat carried 340 of them from Genova, across the Atlantic to the Delaware River, where it slowed to a crawl and inched its way towards Philadelphia. When the boat docked in Philadelphia she and her husband carried their two suitcases nine blocks west and two blocks south. They had gone straight from the boat to his cousin’s house. He told them that Americans think Italians are lazy. He said its because they never walk more than eleven blocks from where they reach land.\r\n\r\nThey worked in the cousin’s fish market until they had enough money to buy the small bakery and coffee shop with the small apartment above it. They made enough money to live and pay off the building, ovens, and espresso machine. They thought they would be able to save a little, put it away, move back to Italy someday, like he told her they would. But as soon as they paid off their debts the supermarkets came.\r\n\r\nNow they made just enough to get by, day by day, charging two dollars a loaf and one dollar fifty for espresso. The logic behind this business had been that people who stopped in for a loaf of bread would see the espresso machine and suddenly want a cup of coffee. It had worked in the days before the supermarket and even today, the few remaining old people from the neighborhood still bought their bread there and always had a cup of coffee as well. There were new customers too. Young people, not Italian, who moved into the neighborhood. They were good-looking, clean, and always seemed happy. They bought bread, drank espresso and left their change on the counter. They said “ciao” when they left.\r\n\r\nShe heard her husband’s feet touch the floor above her and she began to make his coffee. She heard him pee in the toilet, waited for the sound of a flush but it never came. He descended the stairs in a stained, cloth robe, holding tightly to the rail and trying not to bend his knees. He had played soccer when he was younger and now he wished he hadn’t. He was halfway down the stairs when she placed his cup of coffee and sugar bowl on one of the small tables.\r\n\r\n“Buon giorno,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Good morning,” she replied.\r\n\r\n“Fa freddo.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she said. “It’s cold.”\r\n\r\nShe lit another cigarette and continued looking out the window. The chicken man across the street was placing cages of fowl on the sidewalk even though he must have known that the only people who bought live chickens anymore were the Voodoo Society and frat boys from the University of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n“Hai fatto pane?” her husband asked her.\r\n\r\n“No,” she said. “I’ll make the bread.”\r\n\r\nThe ovens in the back of the shop made the small back room feel like a sauna. She lifted a large bag of flour and poured it into the large mixing bowl. She added water, yeast and salt, turned it on and watched the large, deformed hand turn the batter into dough. While the mixer turned she went upstairs and got dressed. She put on white, thermal long underwear. She liked its tightness and warmth. She put on a sweater she had made. It was white and soft, made from rabbit fur. He had been upset when she had bought the yarn farther south on the market. He had said it was too expensive. But it was too late to return, so she kept it and knit a sweater. It was the last thing she had knitted. She put on a long skirt, with bright flowers on it. This too he had thought was excessive.\r\n\r\n“We have customers,” he called.\r\n\r\n“I’m coming,” she said as she slipped her feet into a pair of white, canvas sneakers.\r\n\r\nDownstairs a young man leaned against the counter. A young woman leaned against him, one of her hands in his back pocket. He wore a leather jacket. Hers was made of dark wool. They both had dark hair, were thin, and she could smell her perfume and his cologne. They smelled like rubbing alcohol and dried flowers. She had seen them before, or maybe it was just people who looked like them. They were the young, single people who were moving into the neighborhood, paying incredible prices for houses that only a decade ago were virtually worthless.\r\n\r\n“Buon Giorno,” the young man said.\r\n\r\nThe young woman smiled.\r\n\r\n“Good morning,” she replied.\r\n\r\n“Due espressi per piacere.”\r\n\r\n“Va bene,” she said.\r\n\r\nThe old woman made the small cups of coffee and saw, out of the corner of her eye, the gentle smiles and constant touching of the young couple.\r\n\r\n“We’re going to Atlantic City,” the young man said.\r\n\r\n“Really,” the old woman said. “I’ve never been.”\r\n\r\nThe old man went into the back to turn off the mixer.\r\n\r\n“It’s beautiful,” the young woman said. “All the pretty lights. And the ocean.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure it is,” the old woman said as she placed the coffee in front of them.\r\n\r\nShe knew, that to the young people, it was all beautiful. Maybe they even thought she and her husband were beautiful in the morning light, in that old store, in their old clothes, in the way that old black and white photographs are beautiful.\r\n\r\nWhen she was fifteen, she had seen beautiful things too. It was at an Uncle’s house at the beach. Her parents had sent her there from their house further inland for a vacation. They had bought her a new bathing suit. It was green and white. For a week she did nothing more than sit on the sand, read books and look out into the ocean. She looked at the flat, blue water and the sun shined like small diamonds on the peaks of the small waves. Each day a young boy dragged a blue and white skiff from the sand to the water. He said hello when he passed her. She watched him struggle with the boat, had the urge to help him bring it to the water, but never offered.\r\n\r\nWhen the boat entered the water the boy pushed off the sand with his foot, sat in the middle seat and rowed out to sea until he was nothing more than a dot on the horizon. Several hours later she would watch the dot become larger, the boat crash gently onto the sand, and the boy struggle to pull the boat, the bottom now filled with silvery fish, back to shore.\r\n\r\n“Good afternoon,” he always said.\r\n\r\nIt was a Sunday, her last day at the beach, when the boy began pulling the boat to the water and stopped beside her.\r\n\r\n“Good morning,” he said and sat next to her.\r\n\r\n“Good morning,” she said and looked down at the sand.\r\n\r\nShe did not have to look at him to see the bronzed shoulders or small but muscled arms. She had seen them every day for a week and now that he was beside her she could feel the heat of his sun-drenched skin.\r\n\r\n“Would you like to go in the boat?” he asked.\r\n\r\nHe was older than she was, by a few years, and did not look at her when he asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she said. “I would like to.”\r\n\r\nThey both stood and she walked beside him as he pulled the boat towards the sea. When the boat was half in the water he held her hand as she stepped into it and sat on the seat in the stern. When she was seated he continued pulling the boat until it became light in the water and he jumped in and began rowing.\r\n\r\nThey did not speak as he pulled them out to sea. Ahead she saw only his bare torso, the strong arms pulled the oars and the water glistened behind him. Every so often she turned to look behind her and the land become a beige sliver on the horizon. Small waves slapped against the side of the boat and it rocked from side to side each time he pulled the oars. A small pool of water rested just beyond her toes.\r\n\r\nWhen the people on land were barely visible he stopped rowing. He leaned in close to her and pressed his lips against her cheek. When he sat back down in the middle seat he smiled and looked at her.\r\n\r\nShe pressed her hand against the cheek he had kissed. She couldn’t bring herself to lean forward and kiss his cheek, nor could she tell him that she wouldn’t mind if he did it again. No one outside of her family had ever kissed her on the cheek before and she could feel the blood rushing to her face. She hoped that the week’s worth of sun wouldn’t reveal her embarrassment.\r\n\r\nThe young man wanted to kiss her again and he searched for any sign that would let him know that he could. There was none, only an uncomfortable silence that rested between the two of them.\r\n\r\n“The ocean is blue,” was all she could think of to say.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, “It is blue.”\r\n\r\nHis smile disappeared. He turned the boat around and rowed back to shore until the bow struck sand. He helped her out of the boat and left her in the ankle deep water as he returned to the ocean alone.\r\n\r\nShe wanted to yell out to him, ask him to come back, to take her again, give her another chance. The moment he kissed her she felt something she had not felt before and she wanted to feel it again. Looking back, it seemed the she left any chance for happiness in the boat, and now it was gone. She was too embarrassed to yell out to him, embarrassed to ask him to come back. She told herself she would never let embarrassment decide her life again. But it did, one year later, when the Italian asked her to marry him. She was too embarrassed to say anything but yes.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\n“The dough is ready,” her husband said from the back room.\r\n\r\n“Have a good time,” she said to the young couple as they left the store, hand in hand, entered a long, new car, and drove away.\r\n\r\n“Va bene,” she said to her husband and went into the back room.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she entered the back room he left it to go upstairs and change. She took a handful of flour and spread it across the large table in the middle of the room. The dough in the bowl was warm and sticky in her hands. She took out a handful, sculpted it into a ball and placed it on the table. She molded each ball into a perfect oval, took the serrated knife from the knife rack and made seven careful slices across the first loaf. She repeated the process twenty times and when she finished the uncooked loaves looked like a pod of beached whales.\r\n\r\nThe image of whales made her think of the ocean. The ocean made her think of the boy. The boy made her think of the happy, young couple, on the way to Atlantic City in the middle of winter.\r\n\r\nShe heard the careful depression of bedsprings above her. Her husband had gone back to bed as he often did as she made the bread. But today the springs did not stop and she recognized the sounds of sex coming from the bed and knew that her husband was alone in the room.\r\n\r\n“Pig,” she said under her breath.\r\n\r\nShe had not heard him masturbate in several years. Hadn’t had sex with him in over a decade. If he had come down the stairs, in a different robe, had shaved and trimmed the hair coming out of his ears, wearing the cologne she had bought for him at Christmas three years ago that he had yet to open, and pressed up against her, covered her hands with his over the soft dough, she wouldn’t have left and could have pretended, for a moment, that she was happy.\r\n\r\nShe had thought of leaving before, had even packed a suitcase once, before realizing she had nowhere to go. It was after he had come home drunk, many years ago, smelling of someone else’s perfume. He seemed so happy, proud almost as he came into the bedroom where she pretended to sleep. He took off his clothes, slipped into the bed and cupped her breast in his hand before passing out. As soon as she heard him snore she packed the bag and went downstairs. Instead of leaving she sat at one of the small table and smoked cigarettes. The suitcase was empty and the bread was made by the time he woke up.\r\n\r\nThat night, and many others, came back to her as she listened to her husband’s body above her. When the springs stopped, there was only the soft sound of the gas ovens and she knew that if she stayed more stories would reach her. She wanted, more than anything else, to forget them; except for the story of the young man at the beach.\r\n\r\nShe went to the closet between the rooms and pulled out the large quilted jacket he had bought for her. It was dark purple with at least a hundred small, quilted squares and when she wore it she looked like a large, moving, purple pyramid. She took all the money in the small register and walked out the door as the small bells on the doorbell jingled.\r\n\r\n“Customers,” he said.\r\n\r\nShe walked quickly through the neighborhood that had become Asian, Hispanic and Black. It was only two blocks from where she lived and already she felt like a foreigner. They spoke a language she didn’t understand, wore clothes she could not comprehend and she couldn’t tell if it was her age or limited life that caused these feelings of foreignness.\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood deteriorated as she walked south. The sky was cold and gray and she kept her hands in her pockets in order to keep them warm. She began to see abandoned houses with cats sitting in the vacant windows. Children played with amputated dolls on broken steps and young men leaned on falling walls. She knew she did not belong here, that it was potentially dangerous, but what did it matter? She needed to see the world outside even if it was ugly, decrepit and dangerous.\r\n\r\nA bar stood at the next corner. Black metal screens covered the windows and a fading sign read, Don’s Place, A Place for good folks. She heard a Motown song coming from the walls. They didn’t listen to Motown where she lived. She wondered who the Good Folks were and if they would be nice to her if she sat down and ordered a glass of wine. She wondered what people were like who sat at a bar at nine in the morning.\r\n\r\nShe would have gone in to find out, but before she could cross the street a large black bus pulled up and blocked her path and parked in front of the bar. Oasis Casino was written in sparkling cursive along the side of the bus. Atlantic City’s Newest Paradise, it said. The door to the bus opened and she could hear people exit the bar and enter the bus.\r\n\r\nQuickly she crossed the street, walked to the other side of the bus, waited until all the people from the bar had made their way into the it. She grabbed the silver handle, pulled herself up the three steps and stood next to the driver.\r\n\r\n“How much?” she asked him.\r\n\r\n“How much?” he repeated. “It don’t cost nothin’ to go to Atlantic City.”\r\n\r\nShe turned and faced the other passengers. Even though it was early in the morning the bus had the feel of a wedding reception about to start. The faces in the bus were mostly older, around her age, of all different races–White, Black, Asian and Middle Eastern. It looked like the bus had stopped in every neighborhood in Philadelphia and a few residents from each one had climbed aboard.\r\n\r\nShe found an empty seat by the window in the front row. The seat was large and comfortable. Frank Sinatra songs came through the speakers at a perfectly inoffensive volume and she began to move her fingers to the rhythm of the band. Behind her she could smell the liquor the passengers from the bar had been drinking. They smelled like her husband in the late afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe bus pulled away from the corner towards Broad Street where it headed straight for City Hall and from where she sat the entire city was visible through the front windshield. The sidewalks were alive with a constant stream of well-dressed people in hats and winter coats. Cabs honked at pedestrians and fancy cars. The bus circled around City Hall and she could see the breasts on the statue of Justice that guarded the East entrance. On the other side of the building that separated North from South was the remains of North Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe bus turned onto the highway and drove fast along the wide pavement, oblivious to other vehicles on the road. It crossed the Delaware River that had ice on its banks and a tanker moving slowly along the brown water. She was in New Jersey now, where she had been only a few times before. She had heard of the dumps, of the overpopulation, of the accents and pollution, but from where she sat, with the Atlantic City Expressway stretching before her like a yellow brick road, the state of New Jersey looked like the most beautiful place on earth. On each side of the road trees passed in a green blur and she felt like she had never traveled so fast. Before she could even close her eyes to rest she began to smell the salt air of the ocean. On the horizon she saw the tops of the casinos in Atlantic City.\r\n\r\nIn the garage beneath the Oasis Casino arrows pointed to doors where she could see the lights and circling sirens of slot machines. The bus parked, the door opened and the passengers hurried off, disappearing through the doors of the casino. She got up slowly, held the silver railing and descended the steps, savoring every moment.\r\n\r\n“Good Day,” the driver said as she exited the bus.\r\n\r\n“Good Day,” she said.\r\n\r\nShe walked through the glass doors of the casino, along the red carpet, between the rows of slot machines that sounded and looked like fire trucks off to a blazing fire. She looked at the stars that appeared on the sleeve of her jacket and when she looked up she saw that the ceiling was made up of thousands of tiny lights that shone down upon her purple jacket. Old men and women sat on stools with large cups of coins in their hands, mesmerized by the spinning shapes behind the small glass windows. They dropped coins into the machine, one after another. The lights, sounds, “ohs” and “ahs” of the gamblers made her feel like she was walking through a festival.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the long line of slot machines another set of glass doors opened to the boardwalk. She walked towards them, through them, slowly, like walking through a good dream. The sky was a dark gray, the water was dark green and blue and calm as a lake. Tiny waves crashed gently on the beach. A light snow began to fall. In the distance a small fishing boat rocked in the calm sea. She saw men working the nets on the boat and waved to them. She descended the steps to the sand, took off her white sneakers and socks, left them by the last step and walked to the water.\r\n\r\n“I’m coming,” she said.\r\n\r\nHer feet were becoming cold but she didn’t notice. Nor did she notice the snow or gray sky. The sounds of casinos disappeared and all she could hear was the gentle surf. It was a beautiful day in the summer. She was at her uncle’s house. The boy was in the water, waiting for her. Her toes entered the water, the blood in her veins turned cold.\r\n\r\n“I’m coming,” she said.\r\n\r\nShe was up to her waist in the ocean when the doorman outside the casino noticed her in the water.\r\n\r\n“Get out of the water,” he yelled.\r\n\r\nHer knees buckled and she went under. How cool it felt. The salt seemed to run through her system and when her knees regained their form she emerged from the water as if she were breathing for the first time.\r\n\r\nPeople on the boardwalk began to stop and point. The doorman in his red suit ran across the beach to the water. The men on the small boat stopped tending the nets to watch her.\r\n\r\n“Wait for me,” she said to them.\r\n\r\nShe wanted to tell the young man on the boat that she would come to him, that she was no longer embarrassed and together they could disappear into the sea.\r\n\r\nThe water came up to her chest and again her knees gave out and she went under. She felt his arms slip underneath her and pull her to the surface.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” she said.\r\n\r\nThe doorman lifted her in his arms and she was light in the water. She began to cry. His face was so much older than she remembered it. What horrors he must have been through since she had been away. She wanted nothing more than to make it up to him.\r\n\r\nShe became heavy as he walked her closer to shore. Despite her weight he placed her gently on the dry sand before he ran to the boardwalk to get help.\r\n\r\n“Come back,” she said and closed her eyes.\r\n\r\nSnow continued to fall and she could feel the small flakes instantly melt on her face. She waited for the sun, convinced it would come through the moving clouds and warm the blood and bones that suddenly felt as cold as arctic air.', 'Nate House has been published in Troika Magazine, Chesapeake Bay Magazine, The Boston Globe, The Philadelphia Inquirer, Roadbike Magazine, The Philadelphia Weekly, and The Philadelphia Tribune.

(13, 'Drinking in the Loons', 'My wife Helene says she now has a lover who makes her purr like a kitten.\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you have the decency to just leave me?” she says during our drive. “Why do you insist on sticking around?”\r\n\r\nI comment on the budding trees. In a few minutes all will be forgotten. She’ll start waxing poetic about the loons again, but more and more I get the feeling that half, at least half, of what she says comes straight from the heart. The brain, I recently learned, contains one hundred billion nerve cells, just as many neurons; and a hundred trillion connection points. Hers are not all dead. I’ve asked her neurologist to explain how human memory actually works, but so far he has not given me a clear answer. What I’ve been told is that even people in Helene’s condition are capable of saying exactly what is on their mind.\r\n\r\nI’ve tried to make her happier. We go for a drive every Sunday, usually by the ocean in Gloucester or Rockport or anywhere popular with birds, and we often just sit enjoying the vast scents and colors nature has to offer. But despite my effort, she never misses an opportunity—say, when a beautiful flower garden or an ocean-front home with white spires comes into view—to tell me I could have done better, that she could have done better.\r\n\r\nOne summer day twenty years ago we were driving to my parents’ place in Webster, Massachusetts to introduce them to our young daughter, Isabelle, who is now in college. That day we’d barely turned onto the highway when Helen told me again what to say to my parents: we want to buy the lake house. My father had been talking about selling it for years.\r\n\r\n“I heard you the first time,” I said.\r\n\r\n“There’s no need to be snippy, Adam. I just want to make sure we’re both on the same page. Adam?”\r\n\r\n“We are,” I said.\r\n\r\nWhen we pulled into the driveway my father made us back out onto the dirt road; my tire was pinching the air hose to his pneumatic nail gun. Helene went inside the house to see my mother. I stayed outside with Isabelle. I walked around admiring the new cedar shingles he had nailed on the house. I wondered if he and my mother had changed their minds, and whether they planned to spend their retirement living there year-round. People were doing that—putting in insulation, furnaces, and thermal-paned windows. For many years the house was not much different than it had been when it served as an ice house during my forebears’ semi-successful foray into the ice harvesting business more than a hundred and fifty years before. His hands were sticky with caulk and tar, but he wouldn’t have shaken my hand anyway, and I didn’t have any intention of shaking his. I made myself busy checking out his progress, commenting on how neat and clean the new shingles looked and smelled. The house, with its sturdy, locally milled exposed beams, stood to acquire a welcoming glow, what with Helene’s plans for re-decorating. The bow window afforded a million-dollar panoramic view of the lake, which has an Indian name that translates into “you fish on your side, I’ll fish on mine, nobody fishes in the middle,” which pretty much describes the situation now with Helene and me—two people joined by the big divide.\r\n\r\nThat particular day, my father had finished most of the final row of shingles a little before dinner. I remember watching as he trimmed the final shingle with a block plane to make sure it fit right. Isabelle was rubbing the sleep out of her eyes, wanting to be put down, but there were nails everywhere so I just kept her in my arms. “You’re getting somewhere, Dad,” I said.\r\n\r\n“I guess,” he said with a characteristic grunt. I remember his blue eyes dulled into the crow’s feet that anchored his ruddy face. He grunted again.\r\n\r\nI’m still learning about how memories work—the difference between true memories, which are like facts, and recollections. Most of us embellish our memories, making them stronger and more vivid than the actual experience. I try to avoid doing that because it’s just a guide for sadness. The leader of the spouse support group where Helen lives, a retired minister with a smooth face and annoyingly quick smile, says this is actually counter-productive. He says, “Adam, you can control thoughts to some extent, but not feelings. Memories, forget it, they’re with you for life. Let them come.” I can just imagine the frown he’d muster up if he were to see the “analysis paralysis” I am putting myself through this afternoon. But he also says that thoughts are sometimes just that: thoughts. I can’t imagine anyone ever having benefited from his counsel. I am having more than mere thoughts; an endless movie has overtaken my mind.\r\n\r\nThat day of the visit to my parents, my father told me the property taxes had just gone up. It was a perfect opening for making my wife’s and my interest known, but to avoid a scene, to avoid baring my wants and needs, I simply asked him what he was going to do.\r\n\r\n“Burn it. Collect the insurance money. Head to Florida.”\r\n\r\n“Really?”\r\n\r\n“Shit, yeah.” He tilted his head to the side. He sneered and let out a low little laugh. “Funny, Adam, fifteen years you don’t talk to me, suddenly it’s old home week. I’m burning it and nobody’s going to be able to tell.” I could hear Helen inside telling my mother to put some fresh chive into the potato salad. Knowing dinner was coming helped me relax. My father said, “Don’t think I don’t know what you’re thinking.”\r\n\r\n“What am I thinking?”\r\n\r\n“‘Who fixes up a house then burns it to the ground?’ That’s what. Well, a little electrical short around some kerosene soaked attic insulation - poof; nobody’ll know the difference.”\r\n\r\nI don’t remember what we talked about for the next ten minutes. I watched him work. Eventually, my mother said “Supper!” out the window and Helen appeared at the picnic table with a plate of cold chicken and steaming corn on the cob. She set it down on the table next to the rest of the food and a G clef-shaped pine napkin holder I’d made in seventh grade. She gazed out over the lake, a late-day glassy green, staring at the congregating loons. I remember quite clearly the way the piney wind whipped the beautiful blood hair she had then. I remember the way the wind shift caused the loons to spin around and re-synchronize their food search, which seemed to be a teaching experience for the baby loons judging from the way the mother loon kept nudging the young ones.\r\n\r\n“Look at that, Isabelle,” my wife said, “Look at those smart birds. I could just drink that in all day.”\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nNow as I drive Helen back to Shady Oaks, the nursing home where she lives, we pass a flock of pigeons. “Aren’t they lovely, those loons,” she says.\r\n\r\n“Yes, honey, they are,” I say.\r\n\r\n “They are loons, right?”\r\n\r\n“Sure, can’t you hear them?” I say.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. They seem awfully quiet.”\r\n\r\n“They’re just resting,” I say.\r\n\r\n“Maybe, but—”\r\n\r\nOn the approach of the stone-pillared entrance, she pushes her feet hard against the floor, something called preemptive anxiety, memory at work, which her doctor said is often seen in torture victims—a cruel yearning for what life used to be like before trauma. Her doctor says it’s mostly subconscious, and essentially painless, but he also says the quicker I get her out of the car and into the home, the less chance there is for the emergence of separation anxiety. Two months ago she walked off grounds during a fire evacuation drill. The staff found her knee-deep in the pond across the street, calling out to the birds.\r\n\r\nWhat I do next is pretend we’re going to dinner. It’s the only way to manipulate her compliance. We even talk about the menu. I tell her I am looking forward to dinner, which is technically true. I am looking forward to dinner, just not with her. But for a moment she smiles, thinking about dinner together, something not allowed on the days we go out together, because according to the doctor it causes boundary confusion.\r\n\r\n“She’ll regress,” he says. “It will make her think life has gone back to the way it once was and that she doesn’t belong here. Dropping her at the door is preferable.” So against my better wishes I’ve given in. I don’t argue with the doctor anymore. I have resigned myself in many ways just as much as Helen.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nThe dinner with my parents was predictably tense. Despite my mother’s request, my father didn’t take off his carpenter’s belt. He sat down, opened an Old Milwaukee, and without a word tore through his chicken breast. Then, like a man on a mission, he dug into his mound of potato salad. He opened a second beer, guzzled it down, ate some more potato salad, then wiped his mouth, stood up, and went right back to work on the shingles, leaving my mother, Helene, Isabelle, and me to stare at the loons.\r\n\r\nI looked across at Helen and we exchanged smiles. Like I’d struck a deal. I didn’t have the heart to give any indication of the truth, not after all the decorating plans she had made with graph paper and Post-It notes for furniture markers. I let her think what she wanted, which, looking back, was regrettably cruel and selfish of me. For months she’d been drawing a screened-in porch she wanted me to build her from which she planned to “drink in the loons” and play her flute. Somehow I had convinced myself to wait until my father changed his mind. I told myself it was the prudent thing to do. He didn’t really plan to burn the place to the ground, I reasoned; he was just fishing for a reaction. What’s important, I told myself, is your daughter’s memories of this day, for her to hear the four voices of the loons—the one-note hoot, for intimate communication with mate and chicks;the wail, for long-distance contact; the tremolo, which conveys annoyance or alarm; and my favorite (Helen’s too), the yodel, which is the longest, most complex of the loon’s repertoire—a slow, rising note followed by several undulating phrases, something that marks territory and is intended to drive off intruders.\r\n\r\nA week later, the lake house burned to the ground. According to the newspaper reports, the fire raged for a half-hour before the fire department responded. A night fisherman who saw a ball of fire called the forestry department. Eighteen acres were lost by then. Funny, none of my father’s firefighter buddies had any record of the call from the fisherman. Practically a quarter of the lake was drained putting it out. My father took his settlement check from State Farm and bought a little place on Sanibel Island, where he was, I guess, happy until death.\r\n\r\nNow I am retired. I took a generous buyout from General Electric. No money worries, just nobody to enjoy it with. I take early-morning drives to the Dunkin’ Donuts just to have a purposeful destination. I feed not on muffins or glazed donuts but the high-powered energy of the people, the ones who stand in line with cell phones fixed to their ears while their cars idle in the parking lot, all doing what I used to do. I could buy most of the shoreline on that old lake, but there’s no reason to now.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nWhen I pull up to the nursing home a nurse comes to the door. I put the gear shift in park. I walk around to Helen’s side, hoping to get everything done in one fluid motion. But she is too quick for me. With her finger pressed down on the inside latch my key is useless. Gently, softly, I ask her to please, please lift her finger off the latch. She calls me a bastard, and I begin to holler just to be heard through the glass. Then she calls me a fucking liar. I bang my hand on the roof just hard enough to startle her and cause her finger to slip so the key works. In one swift motion, the car door swings open, and she falls onto the pavement. I lean down to help her up and she bats me away. It won’t be long before the doctor says, “No more Sunday drives.”\r\n\r\nIt will kill me. It already kills me. But this is the only place, I keep telling myself, she is safe. I know what could have happened to her two months ago. I didn’t need to be told “she could have been killed crossing that busy street.” But they told me anyway, like I’d been brought in for questioning. Weren’t they the ones that were supposed to be watching her? I wanted to say this, but I didn’t. I just remember the blinding rage I felt at this staff. For the first time in years I raised my voice and almost said what was on my mind—“I give up”—but instead I blurted out something that has been on my mind for two years, something I never, ever thought I’d have the courage to utter. I said, “Well, maybe she got to see something beautiful, for a change.”\r\n\r\nThat nearly broke the nurses’ hearts.', 'Stephen MacKinnon\'s work has appeared or is forthcoming in Armageddon’s Buffet, Conte, Fugue, Ontario Review, Plum Biscuit, Rosebud, The Southeast Review, The Talking River Review, and Whistling Shade.

(14, 'Think Engineering', 'Dougy tells me they’re Old Squaws.\r\n\r\n“A male and a female,” he says, reaching for binoculars. “Pretty.” His hands are torn, swollen. Sixty year-old meathooks.\r\n\r\nThe wind bites my ears. Steam rises from the sea. A warm winter, I’m told by locals. On the boat, I’m always hungry, my mind on shepherd’s pie, dark beer, fireplaces. Dougy doesn’t seem to feel pain. To look at him you know he’s been there and back. I want that for myself.\r\n\r\n“We saw them in Nova Scotia,” he continues, steering the boat with his foot. If you ask me, I’d call them ducks, but Dougy’s shown me a world I’ve never seen.\r\n\r\nA foghorn blows twice. I admire the rocky expanse of the pier, the white church steeples as we draw further away from the land. Boat exhaust smokes from the distant harbor, gulls shoot for the sky. Dougy chucks the binoculars into a bin he calls the photo shop, a plastic container filled with underwater cameras he’s crafted from old engine cylinders. A former cod fisherman, Dougy’s now an ocean observer. He even changed his boat’s name from Cover to The Ocean Reporter. The federal government pays him to monitor and videotape the seas of Cape Ann. He also does sediment testing in Gloucester Harbor.\r\n\r\nFrom Paradise, California, I came here to Pigeon Cove, Massachusetts. Three years in Paradise and the town was on to me. One too many boozy missteps. Before, I’d been five years in Cave Creek, Arizona, three in Big Sky, Montana, two seasons in Steamboat Spring, Colorado. British Columbia once upon a time. I always know when to go, when time’s up. Once the scenery turns bland, I scram.\r\n\r\nI had a girlfriend in Paradise and though we didn’t like each other, we did share a fondness for red wining away what bothered us. On my way to work one Sunday (Maintenance Electrician), I drove right past the building. With each mile gained, I considered what I might be losing, and all that nagged me was a succulent house plant I’d managed to hold onto for five years. I was already halfway to the other side of our country, driving a car born the same year as me, and the imagesn’t enough to make me U-turn. I could only hope she’d water it. Having never been east of Chicago, I wondered if the other side might be different. So I drove my Duster until the transmission grinded out across from Dougy’s house in Pigeon Cove.\r\n\r\nHe practically rebuilt the junker in his pebble driveway. Only made one trip to AutoZone, the rest of the parts Dougy built himself; he has that kind of imagination. Dougy’s struggle was to keep pace with his mind, to sort out the ongoing discourse between his ears. He talked to his tools—asking who was best suited for a particular job. He stirred his coffee with Allen wrenches, itched his nuts with screwdrivers, picked his teeth with feeler gauges. There was no room for my help so I stayed inside savoring the warmth of Cinnamon Schnapps, studying the classifieds, paging through maritime photos. During breaks, he showed me his underwater films, pointing out glittery specks that meant the world to an explorer. I was taken by the dark green warmth, the gloomy calm one-hundred feet below. The trash and treasure. When he showed me a blue shark chasing the camera, I froze.\r\n\r\n“Did you go to school for this?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Yeah,” he said, fast-forwarding. “Rockport High.”\r\n\r\nHe shared his ocean, above and below, showed me more than bikinis and boogie boards.\r\n\r\nThe car was ready on Superbowl Sunday. “Sounds like a Caddy now,” Dougy said, turning over the thirty year-old engine. When it came time to reconfigure the wiring harness, he finally needed me. “I try not to meddle with wires,” he said. “I have a ginny in Gloucester who does my electrical.” Dougy: a mechanical maestro who fears magnets, motion, coils of wire. And this is how I came to work on The Ocean Reporter: powering up his shoddy AV equipment, wiring his grand visions together while he handles what he calls “think engineering.”\r\n\r\nDougy rents me a small, sloping apartment above a pottery shop. “My daughter lived there once,” he told me. “Druggy,” he whispered. His cheeks reddened; I felt his shame. We were at a tavern in New Hampshire, a converted foundry that smelled like wet dog. No booze for nine years, Dougy says he can get a buzz just being inside a bar. “I think she’s in New Orleans,” he continued, turning his coffee mug upside down.\r\n\r\nI couldn’t talk to Dougy about drugs. Couldn’t explain the sacred highs, the wounded lows, the dead time in between. Couldn’t suggest his daughter was in terrible agony. I didn’t want to ruin anything by showing him a world I’ve seen.\r\n\r\nDougy finished the torpedo this morning, a crude four-foot steel missile with three rear fins, two front wings, a black nose cone. A weapon. Before today, we mounted the camera onto a bulky pipe box, hardly the aerodynamic phallus before me now.\r\n\r\n“We going after someone?” I ask, climbing aboard, my ass wet from the dinghy.\r\n\r\n“An Oscar,” he says, attaching lead weight to the bottom of the missile. The camera is wedged into the tail end of the pipe. “I need you to wire it through this hole here.” Dougy points to a square cut-out on the top side of the torpedo, just in front of the tow clamps. He tells me we’re going to troll the torpedo behind the boat at 2.5 knots. Adjustments will be made by adding weight, trimming the fins, reconfiguring the position of the tow line. As I fiddle with wires, he talks, talks, talks—think engineering his way through a process I hardly understand.\r\n\r\nFrom the stern, Dougy dumps the torpedo overboard like trash, and I study the video screen from inside the captain’s cabin, which is mercifully equipped with a space heater. The screen’s fuzzy until the torpedo finds bottom sixty feet below the surface. I press record on the VCR. A car battery provides our power.\r\n\r\n“Bottomed,” I call out astern.\r\n\r\nI’m always stunned by the first glimpse of the ocean floor, the quiet mystery Dougy captures from such distance. I imagine what ghosts might drift by the screen, what strangeness I may encounter alone inside the cabin. At the bar, I tell people it’s like the moon down there, another universe right in our midst, but they don’t care. They were born into this. I bet early man was shocked when he discovered life under the surface, I tell them. I bet he couldn’t get over it.\r\n\r\nDougy ties down the tow line and runs into the cabin, increasing the boat’s speed to 2.5 knots. My eyes hold the picture, the torpedo revealing the underwater behind us. Little fish jet across the screen, the ocean floor dusting up as the torpedo scrapes bottom.\r\n\r\n“See there,” Dougy says, pointing. “It’s trolling sideways. Weight distribution problem.” He pulls on his stubbly chin, considering.\r\n\r\nI don’t see why we can’t film sideways. What’s the difference? I wonder. But this isn’t mine.\r\n\r\nMy arms ache as we haul in the torpedo, fingers stiffen as the icy Atlantic soaks into my joints. With forearms like Popeye, a detached calm on his face, Dougy shows no sign of strain. “Got caught,” he says, referring to the missing nose cone. “I’ll make a new one tonight.” I scan the surface for something black. “See here,” he says, pointing to the fins, rubbing the shiny spots with his fingers. “That’s where she was dragging across the floor.” He sits down, absorbs the torpedo like a father would a sick child.\r\n\r\n.  .  . \r\n\r\nThat night, I buy a woman a drink, then another. She’s child-faced, chubby, a gold chain dangling between her melons. An orange tabby cat saunters across the bar, rubs against our dirty long sleeves. I tell her about the torpedo scraping the ocean floor and swinging sideways. “Weight distribution,” I say, speaking as the ocean observer, the think engineer. I mention the abyss.\r\n\r\n“The chaos before God’s Creation,” she says, tapping her cross. I ask her if she could live in such silence. She burps, points to her empty glass. She likes free drinks; she doesn’t seem to like me, but I don’t care. We all want desperately in here.\r\n\r\nIt’s dark: I’m tangled up in my sunken green couch. My clothes are on, boots placed neatly next to the couch, socks tucked inside. A half can of beer’s wedged into my crotch. I still have my wallet. I stretch, the phone falls to the floor. Shit.\r\n\r\nIt’s between late and early, a perilous place where I pray for change, swear I won’t wake up here again. I call out for the chubby girl, but there’s no answer. No one’s here.\r\n\r\nThe phone rings at 7:00 AM.\r\n\r\n“You working today or what?” Dougy shouts. I hear a lathe going in the background.\r\n\r\nI hang up, sit up, throw up, and head up to the docks. The morning sky is the color of blue popsicle. The ocean’s choppy, sudsy. Dead low tide. A seagull shits on my windbreaker. I wonder how all this will turn out.\r\n\r\nDougy pisses off the side of the boat. “I cut off the front fins,” he says pensively. “We’ll see where that takes us.” A young preppy couple and their beagle rush away from our side of the dock. “I made a nose cone from lobster buoy,” he continues. “Bright orange and it floats. We won’t lose it again.”\r\n\r\nI blow chunks over starboard, dregs of a blackout.\r\n\r\n“Are you going to make it?” he asks.\r\n\r\n“Yeah,” I say, wiping my mouth. I scrub my mess from the starboard rail, straining to remember if I phoned him last night.\r\n\r\nHe holds my gaze, his exterior soft without his Navy cap.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry, Dougy.”\r\n\r\nHe unties the bow line, his back to me now. “You’re coming to a fork,” he says.\r\n\r\n“I know,” I say.\r\n\r\nAnd I do. There aren’t many places left to go, and I wonder if I’ll make it thirty more years. Perhaps he once considered this too.\r\n\r\n“Get your sea legs,” he says. “We’re shoving off.”\r\n\r\nThe torpedo still drags. The video screen’s a fog, the rear fins grate the ocean floor. I wiggle the wires, hoping it has to do with connection, but all my leads show twelve volts.\r\n\r\n“It’s sideways again,” I call out.\r\n\r\nIn the cabin, he increases speed to 3.3 knots. The shadowy screen steadily illuminates. “See there,” he says. “I need to shorten the tow line. That’ll help movement at 2.5. We can’t record at 3.3.”\r\n\r\n“The light’s funny,” I say, studying the screen. “It’s brighter on the lower half.”\r\n\r\n“That’s because the camera’s upside down now. The torpedo’s flipped over. Look,” he says, poking my shoulder. “The sun can’t shine from the bottom of the sea.”\r\n\r\n.  .  . \r\n\r\nDougy doesn’t use computer programs to modify his inventions. He says that’s for NASA. Instead, he think engineers his plan before going to bed. “Then the solution comes to me in my dreams,” he’ll pronounce. The next morning, he’ll be surprised to discover the work hasn’t been done, the corrections haven’t been made, because healready did the job in his mind.\r\n\r\nI can’t imagine accomplishing anything in my dreams. My dreams are terrifying: tidal waves, alligators, me screwing a jellyfish. All I have at night is fear.\r\n\r\n“Rollers,” Dougy says the next morning, a wet unlit cigar between his teeth. Sun melts icicles from the cabin roof. Yesterday was a year ago.\r\n\r\nHe tells me the wheels are from an old baby carriage he found at the transfer station. “They’ll keep the torpedo smooth,” he says. “She’ll glide. No more sideways, no more upside down. No more sun under the sea.” He tells me he dreamed of his little brother last night, remembers pushing him around in a stroller when they were runts, when their mother was too tired, their father too busy at the docks. “That’s when I figured it out.”\r\n\r\nThe torpedo moves across the ocean floor like the Mars Rover. No bumps, no drags, no resistance. We’re steady at 2.5. The picture’s glorious. I imagine classical piano playing in the background.\r\n\r\n“Perfect,” I call astern.\r\n\r\nDougy rushes the cabin, snowflakes melting on his cap. We’re both silent, our focus on the screen. He’s close, smells like fuel. The Ocean Reporter groans from the wake.

Then I tell her I’ll buy all she can drink if she’ll just cover her eyes. She does, reaches blindly for her fresh whiskey sour.\r\n\r\nI show her everything from the bottom of the ocean.', 'Michael Schiavone’s fiction has appeared or is forthcoming in New Letters, Reed Magazine, GSU Review, Connecticut Review, Mississippi Review, and the Tartts 2 Fiction Anthology.

(15, 'If You Don\'t', 'When Ryan is four and Colleen is two, another toddler comes up to her in the sandbox and kicks over the upside down bucket mold she’s just finished patting down to perfection. She throws her hands up in the air and lets loose with a great wail and Ryan stomps over to push the offending party down into the sand. Colleen’s daddy Dan is first on the scene, the source of wailing belonging to him. He picks his daughter up out of the sand and dusts her off. The antagonistic toddler is still in the sand also crying and it is perhaps the bizarre juxtaposition of this and must be the Nutcracker Suite playing out of the daycare’s mounted playground speakers that strikes him so funny when he turns and sees the way Ryan is staring up at him, fixated. Dan doesn’t understand how unnerved he is until he realizes he’s honestly trying to screw up enough courage to ask a preschooler which mommy is his when she tumbles into the picture in a way recalling sudden spring storms, or flash floods. All it takes is a glance at her boy and her eyes shoot over and up to Colleen, cradled in his arms and quiet, now that she’s being rocked. The woman’s eyes find his, flick down then back up in a way that’s reptilian, its economy disturbing to him, the efficiency with which she reads him, sizes him up in the dart of a snake’s tongue. Her lips at last break into a smile and he loves her, all at once. This moment seals up around his life, a valve separating Before from After.\r\n\r\nSure is a pretty little girl you got there, she says and means it.\r\n\r\nYou’re right about that, he smiles back, Handsome boy you got yourself. He seems a bit taken with my Colleen, here.\r\n\r\nSeems like, she barely takes her eyes off the girl herself, this boy falls in love with a different color or shape every five or ten minutes.\r\n\r\nWell, he looks about as smart as a whip, Dan purrs back.\r\n\r\nHe does pretty good so far. Listen, I’ve got to keep moving—\r\n\r\nBefore you go! Dan lays it on thick, too thick. He palms a card up from out of his sleeve, magic.\r\n\r\nWhat’s this? she asks over her shoulder, already herding Ryan off to the next gig.\r\n\r\nMy number! he shouts back, and feels like an idiot, because most of the parents know that even though he hasn’t slept in the same bed as Sheila in, God, six months now, he still isn’t technically divorced from his wife, in terms of the proper papers being filed at the appropriate times, etcetera and in perpetuity.\r\n\r\nWell I’ll call you if I need, she squints for a closer look, a tax lawyer! Nice meeting you, Daniel James, CPA!\r\n\r\nHe stands there stunned, entranced, for a few seconds more then rallies, realizes he’s still holding Colleen. Didn’t even ask the lady’s name. Just hurled his information at her like the world was falling at his feet. What came over him?\r\n\r\nWe got to get Daddy a damn hamburger and you some mush, champ, he says like she’s his best friend. And, really, she is. His only friend, right now. The only one who’ll listen. And he loves her more than he does the rest of the world combined.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nWhen Ryan is ten and Colleen is eight, after the most wonderful series of box forts and action figure wars and doll autopsies and afternoons spent dressing up as all the superheroes and tea parties and massacres and innumerable games of Hide and Seek and Motorcycle and another one they made up called Liar and archery chicken-fights and multidimensional scavenger hunts and always a round of Army to close things out, then the whole mess comes tumbling down when Ryan’s dad Jim finally confirms his long-harbored suspicions that the debonair English chap who’s been turning up too often for way too long is not in fact English but has in fact been rogering his wife for probably exactly that length of time. Immediately setting in motion a chain of events ending with the immaculately lit commingling of the brains and blood of the conflicting parties upon the otherwise white ivory mantle bounding a fireplace you could fit three people into with Ryan’s mother as the sole witness to and survivor of her husband’s homicide/suicide with her lover, Colleen’s daddy Dan.\r\n\r\nNobody takes it harder than Ryan. And it’s only because of what it does, the gap it puts between them. He loves his daddy, he really really does, but losing her, spending the long and lonely afternoons without her, it’s so much worse. And she’s actually still out there, can make it better. Daddy’s just dead.\r\n\r\nBut she might as well be, too. No one ever answers when he dials the right numbers and Mommy shushes him every time he brings it up, every time. Hurts so much more without, just to know what he’s missing. The lines of her face, those pretty pretty curves. Oh, how much he loves just the idea of her, a picture of her face. The real thing makes him want to burst.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nWhen Ryan is fifteen and Colleen is thirteen, all of his plans come to fruition, too much hard work paying off to even begin to acknowledge here, let alone explain. Certainly not fathom. Suffice to say, even though they have been separated for a period of roughly sixty-two months, he has not let her slip away from his scrutiny for more than days at a time and securing himself a slot on the roster for Camp Ya Hah feels like the crowning achievement of his life. She’s been living in a home down by the border but he tracks her name into the enrollment drives and signs himself up right away. Mom’s so busy with Michael, she’s glad to be rid of him. And Camp Ya Hah is a pretty great place. Wonderful, you might even call it.\r\n\r\nThere’s hiking and fishing and archery and swimming and cliff diving and spelunking and this big old swing they built and an artificial hot spring and a guy preaching about how all this is from God and they can most of them pretty much get behind that, why not? They actually keep the girls on the other side of the lake from the boys, just like in an old horror movie, so how can he not rise or in this case submerge himself to the occasion and scuba on over to his intended?\r\n\r\nBut something’s wrong, immediately. When he gets across, all the counselors, the ladies supposed to be in charge are floating in the lake or running around the shore, laughing and falling down, a couple in their underwear…Ryan, determined as he is to reach his beloved, so close, weighs this gift horse and allots it the requisite minimum two minutes, just floats there, his goggles the only thing sticking up out the water. Watching.\r\n\r\nHe makes landfall around the corner from where the counselors are falling all over themselves, crawls up on the sand and hunkers down, waiting for them to come for him. When no one shows, he creeps up into the camp. No one’s in their cabin. He pokes his head into three empty rooms full of bunk beds but waits outside the fourth one. It’s hers. Red Poodle. The eponymous mascot crouches out in front of the cabin with a vigilance that can be judged oblivious but loving. Everyone’s either at Mess or on a hike. He’s had the schedule for weeks now, this plan has been revised and rerevised, actually bearing great resemblance to the fourth of fifth draft of the original even though this is something like the twentieth.\r\n\r\nHe leaves them under her pillow. A burnt-eyed sawed-off Barbie head, some new cousin calling herself Candace actually. A tiny broken piece of China that might be part of a fine cup of tea, held by smaller hands than even Candace’s. And an old Princess Leia action figure, just the torso up, in her slave girl steel bikini. Long ago, ritualistically, burned in the same places as Candace. All part of the same experiment. The Matador Trials. Something about taking pain and flinching.\r\n\r\nThey’re all folded up in a skewed sort of crab origami and on the paper there’s a note telling her to meet him tomorrow night out at the Skull Island the boy counselors rigged up in the middle of the lake, to do who knows what, a couple of years ago (even the owners still have no idea about it, everybody says). But she’ll meet him, she’ll come. She has to.\r\n\r\nAnd she does. She almost explodes into a million pieces there in the dark when her hands find the smushed paper and unroll these old things, lost forever. Touching them now, she realizes how much more a part of her they were than she realized, more prominent inside than out at this point. She’s missed Ryan.\r\n\r\nBut Daddy. Just the briefest flash of him and she wants to burn these things the rest of the way to Hell. It was his Mama, his mama did it.\r\n\r\nSo she lies there for the better part of the night; when she does get to dreaming, it takes more of a toll on her than the insomnia, visions of falling out and away from a great but distant light into a darkness whose vastness is far more boundless. The next day, crawls by tough to get through. But she makes it, finally makes it, her bed and her sheets. Wakes up in a cold sweat right on time, twenty minutes to midnight, just long enough to get out there. But she’s so tired. And doesn’t know what she’s doing.\r\n\r\nHe’s hugging the bottom of the lake when he sees her sinking, fires himself up at her and breaks the surface in seconds. She’s not breathing when he checks her on the girl’s side of the lake but after some CPR pseudo-kissing, he’s got her coughing and spitting up water, a good sign, certainly. But then she starts talking.\r\n\r\nWha—what’re you—?\r\n\r\nSaving, I’m saving you.\r\n\r\nWanna go back. Take me back right now.\r\n\r\nBack where? Down there? You can’t—\r\n\r\nBack away from you. That’s where.\r\n\r\nBut can’t you see that I love you? That this was the point of the whole thing? We’re supposed to be the good that comes out of it? Do you know what a phoenix is?\r\n\r\nIf you don’t let me go, right this very instant, I’m gonna scream bloody murder.\r\n\r\nScream all you want. No one can hear you, my pretty. Hah. Come on. We’re already on your side. Let me help you up.\r\n\r\nShe doesn’t say another word to him. He gets thrown out less than a week later.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nBut he still finds her, the pest. She bets he always will, if she ran a million miles, hitched up to Alaska, took a ferry across the Bering Strait, rode a motorcycle around Asia, went out into the African desert and then flew on even further, she would find him crouched in some Irish pub or English bookstore, waiting there weeks for her to quit second- and fourth-guessing herself and just do what she’d always intended, what he’d known she’d do within his first few instants of thinking about it. Waiting for her to catch up with herself. That’s what drives her so crazy about him, if you had to sum it up in just a few words. Yeah, that’s actually pretty good. Just sort of the way he has of knowing about everything. Drives her nuts.\r\n\r\nWhen Ryan is eighteen and Colleen is sixteen, so much has flown right by and set itself up like it’s always been the truth that it’s tough to know where to start. She just can’t in any way believe that it’s coincidence but they’ve both wound up in Houston, her with some fosters, him because She wants to live there because Houston has all the best hospitals for precious Michael, he of jaundiced skin and bone-marrow transplants. Ryan doesn’t even care that he’s a legend at school for stalking a soph who’s not even interested. It scares her, the way he stares at her, when she catches him, even though he stops as soon as he’s caught. He’s such an idiot. Why should she have anything to do with him? And his fucking mom?\r\n\r\nBut then she’s walking around by herself drunk at this nice little fair they’re having in the middle of the city at this park and of course he’s there, just like always, right over her left shoulder, and he says, Do you want to ride the train? and she says O, why not? Not like you’ll take No for an answer, and how she wants to slap him for the way he looks at her then but she sort of wants to snuggle him up too and what’s odd is that’s not even new, has always been around the back there somewhere, and she never says Yes but they stand in line anyway and wait for the train then finally board but it takes forever for all the moms and crying hollering kids to get on, such a racket. Finally, the five-feet tall cars chug on out of the station, sixty long, capacity of four apiece. She smiles at him without deciding that it’s all right to.\r\n\r\nWhy’re you always following me?\r\n\r\nI’m not. I’m just around when you need me.\r\n\r\nOh yeah? And why do I need you now? To ride this train?\r\n\r\nNo. To save you from this train.\r\n\r\nWhat’s at? Whadaya mean?\r\n\r\nThe train. Someone’s going to blow this train up.\r\n\r\nThe hell’re you talking about?\r\n\r\nI am. Me. I’m going to blow this train up. If you don’t marry me, Colleen.\r\n\r\nShe sees dark spots and feels herself laughing even though nothing’s funny, certainly not. He takes a box out and opens it up and there’s a little gold band inside, dent accentuated by the lampposts they’re chugging by.\r\n\r\nI’m not gonna—why would I marry you?\r\n\r\nBecause you can walk this earth for the rest of your life as fast as you can and you’ll never find a man who adores you more. Or will love you more than I do. It’s you and me. That’s it. You don’t have to see it now, that’s all right. I can wait.\r\n\r\nOnly you’ll blow up the train.\r\n\r\nThat. At’s just to get you in gear, rev up the motor. No pressure, really.\r\n\r\nShe breathes in involuntary and the taste catches her just right, she knows, can see this road burning bright in front of her occluding the other paths, so many might-be’s falling away before the obvious truth that he’s already so much inside of her, she’s just hurting herself to shut him out, and it’s perfect and beautiful and a little sad because it’s over in an instant there in the passenger car, just like that, inside, she ages from the wild angry bitch ready to smash her hands against the world into the same old soul she’ll be when she dies ninety-two years later, the skeleton of her life charted out before her, in front instead of behind, but charted all the same, all the choices of the world burned away even though she can hardly remember making a single one to begin with.\r\n\r\nOh, what the hell, she says to him like she always has, always will, Let’s give it six months and see what happens. How much more fucked up can it get from here?', 'Rob Bass is a writer/musician living in Austin with his wife.

(16, 'Hybrid', 'I\'m looking at myself in the taxi’s side mirror. You will never get a kiss because you’re invisible, the mirror says, a glare of sun where my face should be. You’re not fine as a frog’s hair, you’re no longer a chick but not yet a hen with a golden egg in your gut, you’re not even a girl; you’re a pair of goat-legs, too plain to be seen. I’m glad, I tell the mirror back. Have you ever heard of Invisible Fence, a firm that makes electronic enclosures no more discernable than air to keep dogs in their backyards? Who knows what will happen for me if I stay hidden, a skinny thirteen-year old with skinny brown hair.\r\n\r\nI wear a t-shirt across my just beginning chest that reads CHICKEN RIGHTS, and no one sees that, certainly not Daddy and Grandma Lorna bickering in the taxi’s back seat. I’m sitting up front beside the cabbie who will eventually pull over and tell us to get out; I can see that in his jaw clenching and unclenching, his brows frowning into one straight line. He’s probably from a country where you eat flies and dirt and AK-47s.\r\n\r\n“Not the scenic route,” Daddy says, knocking on the Plexiglas. “Take Amsterdam.”\r\n\r\nThe driver hears Daddy’s voice which is plainly masculine and his nose curls.\r\n\r\n“Pete, let him drive,” Grandma Lorna pipes up.\r\n\r\nDaddy has on a summer dress, a form-fitting pink bodice that flares into a full skirt and a pair of pink Paradise Kitten sling-back pumps. On his head is the Carmen—twenty inches of luxurious coppery curls and soft bangs. At home on his dresser are the Holly, Rebecca, and Amber. The Carmen suits his blue eyes. As a man Daddy was fabulous and handsome. Now he’s unmarried and a too-pretty middle-aged woman with tree-trunk legs who takes bounding steps. A cross between a male leopard and a lioness. A Leopon.\r\n\r\n“Ma, my name is Kim, remember?” Daddy snaps.\r\n\r\n“Well,” Grandma Lorna says, “sit back, Kim.” All day she’ll say Pete, Kim, Pete, Kim. I’d wish she’d settle on one just like I’ve stuck with Daddy and him.\r\n\r\n“Do you want to end up in Times Square?” Daddy taps on the partition behind my head with his thumb ring. “Dalloway, tell him to take Amsterdam.”\r\n\r\nI roll my eyes. Easter break, Mommy in Albany, and I’m supposed to be with Daddy for a week of urban adventure. He promised we’d walk the length of Manhattan from the tip of Inwood to the South Street Seaport, we’d eat Russian and revolve around the city at the Rainbow Room, we’d listen to old piano bar crooners, and now everything’s different, everything’s about Grandma Lorna.\r\n\r\n“Sir, do you think you we could go down Amsterdam?” I ask, knowing it’s best to phrase a directive as a question. The cabbie makes no sign that he hears. His lids are at half mast like stove hoods taking in whiffs of smoke. Printed on the dash next to a 1-800 complaint number are his name, Iyad Sarraj, and a photograph. I trace my fingers over his forehead.\r\n\r\n“I’m going to need ice packs. Perhaps, Dalloway will volunteer to hold them to my face when we get home,” Grandma Lorna whispers. You wouldn’t know from her breathy utterances that she earned a degree in mathematics and has her pilot’s license. Two days ago she underwent surgery at the Manhattan Ears, Eyes, Nose & Throat Hospital. When I turn to look at her she tries to smile but the swelling squeezes her cornflower blue eyes almost shut. She’s had a full-face lift, including chin and jowls. Her cheeks have been chemically peeled and they glisten like wet red peaches. A gauze bandage winds under her chin and over the top of her head resembling a catcher’s mask. Only her ponytail and orange velveteen ribbon seem to have escaped injury. Last night I took a look at some of her rejuvenation brochures, and one sentence keeps making its way around in my head. “Some patients receive an enhanced arch at the ends of their eyebrows, giving them a cat-like look that is extremely exotic.” Like Dante’s leopard-creature the Lonza, who represents Lust.\r\n\r\nDaddy taps. “If you keep going we’ll end up in Times Square.”\r\n\r\n“Kim, did I tell you I began to hemorrhage from my face on the operating table?” Grandma Lorna says. “The surgeon was repositioning too much skin.”\r\n\r\nDaddy says Grandma Lorna suffers from narcissistic borderline personality disorder and never gave him enough attention to become a fully operational human being. Every word out of her mouth crawls under his skin.\r\n\r\n“He says I could have bled to death. Did you hear?” Grandma Lorna asks, just as the taxi hits a plate that covers a pothole. The metal clangs like the Croatian church bell. I don’t want to grow old like Grandma Lorna, to tear up my face to remake it. People have been remaking themselves for forever. In school we studied Leopold Ollier who pioneered free skin grafting and would take a piece of periosteum from the long bone of a rabbit or a cockerel, and transplant it to the skin of the forehead. Then there were alar reductions pioneered by Robert Weir in 1892 to reduce the flare of the nostril rim or a wide nostril floor or both. In those days they operated with saws and awls and phrenology charts.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nThe driver accelerates as if there are miles of empty highway in front of us not another taxi a few feet from our bumper. Times Square rushes at us with all the traffic trying to squeeze itself through the needle’s eye. Daddy and I used to walk here when they were making old Times Square into the new one. At six years old I thought the gigantic Chock Full-of-Nuts coffee cup blowing off clouds of steam was heaven and the girl in the Calvin Klein ad soaring over the canyon, a goddess with story-high thighs and the tallest pelvic bones in the world. Now I realize the model’s belly button is only the size of two human beings.\r\n\r\nDaddy pounds on the partition with his red-fingernailed fist. “So this is how you get passengers to 45thStreet?”\r\n\r\nThe driver slides open the partition. “Traffic bad. Construction.”\r\n\r\nGrandma Lorna’s hand goes to her nose. “Pete, what is that smell?”\r\n\r\n“It’s Kim, Ma. My name is Kim.”\r\n\r\n“Kim, I think it’s that driver who stinks.”\r\n\r\nThat driver slams the Plexiglas shut. I take a deep breath, nothing heavy about his odor. Maybe she smells herself, the Opium perfume that hangs over her like a murky river haze. The stuff rich white ladies wear that is so oily it can’t be washed off in a shower. They scrape the anal glands of civet cats to make it. Grandma Lorna has Opium in eau de toilette, parfum classic, dusting powder, and body cream. Smartmouth.com perfume reviews says that if you can smell perfume a foot away you’re wearing too much. You can smell Grandma Lorna at four yards. The muscle in the driver’s cheek twitches and he jams his foot to the gas pedal and we lurch forward.\r\n\r\nGrandma Lorna shrieks. “Pete, my face. I hurt my face. I’m getting sick. That stench. Kim, my face.” The jolt must have thrown her forward because her head disappears below the seat and I hear her gagging, and then throwing up. My forehead goes hot and the red burns through my cheeks.\r\n\r\n“Ma, stop. Oh, please, for God’s sake,” Daddy shouts. “Here’s some Kleenex. Ma, are you all right?”\r\n\r\nThe light changes, the taxi squealing to the curb in front of the Holiday Inn, and the red feeling spreads to my chest and down my arms. This is it. This is where it will happen.\r\n\r\n“Get out,” the driver commands.\r\n\r\nI let go of a deep breath, and when I inhale I smell the sour cornmeal of Grandma Lorna’s vomit. “Please, she’s just been operated on.” I point to his New York Taxi Association license affixed to the dashboard. Then I take out my V-ball pen and write his medallion number on my forearm. “Am I spelling your name right? I-y-a-d?”\r\n\r\nFor the first time he looks at me. Fugly me. His lip curls. “Get out. You don’t have to pay. Dirty bolis. All of you smell up my cab.”\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nTimes Square is the crossroads of the world. You only notice the truly dazzling and the hideous, Puerto Rican beauties with banana lips and the bag ladies. How beautiful or ugly do you have to be to be seen? Watching Grandma Lorna from the back is worse than seeing her from the front. Her square ass tries to wiggle in gray stretch pants that have stretched too much. She’s tied a sweater from her neck, which is festooned with lint balls. Daddy who knows how to dress as a male and female didn’t learn his style from her. His real father was an Irish window dresser who beat Grandma Lorna, and she left him before Daddy was a year old. The next year she managed to hook a bank president and lead him to the altar. You wouldn’t know by her appearance that she’s one of the Hudson Valley’s wealthiest women.\r\n\r\nI swing Grandma’s overnight case over my shoulder and disappear. You can’t hold onto yourself here, not when the Virgin Megastore and MTV signs tower and the digital headline making its way around the New York Times Building announces NORTH KOREA RESUMES WEAPONS GRADE PLUTONIUM. I don’t feel my arms and legs or the breath in my mouth. Everything happens fast. Lion King Theater and Muddy Waters Blues Club. Zanzibar. Gangsta girls in low-riding jeans and silver sequin tops, Dominican chicks in gold lame stovepipe pants carrying gold guitar purses, and behind them ex-burb white guys trying to strut under the weight of their boa constrictor dreads.\r\n\r\n“Catch up, Dalloway, my little duck.” Daddy stops with Grandma Lorna in the middle of the sidewalk. “Quack quack you’re falling back.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t walk any faster,” I lie.\r\n\r\nTourists turn to gawk at Grandma Lorna. The crowded sidewalk is separating, people moving to the side to let her through. The Red Sea parting. URINE TOWN is coming down from the marquee. A man in bowler hat sits on a fire hydrant. “Are you an actress?” he asks Grandma Lorna. She stops to give him a giggle and he tips his hat. He’s about the right age for her.\r\n\r\nWe pass a bunch of project boys. They’re tall and show upper body strength in their slow-moving strut. It feels like hours before they pass us. “Whoa! There she is, man. That sea hag’s your girlfriend. Lookee!” the tallest one snickers, elbowing his friend, and throwing a thumb at Grandma Lorna. “What a face!”\r\n\r\nThe shorter one laughs loud enough to wake the fish in the East River. “That’s your mama. Go on, man, and scrape the barnacles out of your old sea hag.”\r\n\r\nI hope the sidewalk opens and sucks them in. Daddy and Grandma Lorna don’t seem to have heard.\r\n\r\n“I insist we wait for Dalloway,” Grandma Lorna says, reaching out her hand “Every time I walk through Times Square,” she says, “I think of the late late movies I watched as a girl in that tiny town of Highland, New Jersey. They were interrupted by advertisements for Revco vegetable slicers and shredders. They could only be ordered by writing New York, New York. Now I am here in New York. The sexiest address in the world, the address of all the Chop-o-Matics.”\r\n\r\n“Are you feeling better, Grandma Lorna?” I ask.\r\n\r\n“The fresh air always helps, kiddo.”\r\n\r\nI glance at her cut up face and look away.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nBlack metal shelves climb the walls of Daddy’s two-bedroom apartment from ceiling to floor. There are containers filled with Popular Science, Architectural Life, Wineries of the Napa Valley clippings. Businesses he wants to invest in when Grandma Lorna dies and makes him rich: jaglion (jaguar x lion) hybrids, ostrich farming to produce eggs low in cholesterol, Nap World where business people can power nap, and rocketry to thrust garbage barges into outer space for quasars and solar flares to fry. Three boring days later Grandma Lorna is still recovering in Daddy’s apartment. The bathroom and kitchen sinks are littered with her tapes and gauzes, ointments, rinsing pans and soaking solutions. She’s entranced by the lumps and bruises, the yellowish discolorations as she waits for the miracle of growing young. Opium saturates even the dust motes. She calls out in her little voice. “Am I less bruised?” I understand now that a whisper can run a household as well as a shout.\r\n\r\nDaddy shuts himself into the second bathroom to exercise, running on double carpets for twenty minutes. He huffs and puffs like my old daddy used to. In those days he’d come out dripping sweat, his chest, his arms, his hair raining droplets the size of grapes and chase Mommy and me. He’d shake the slimy sweat onto us and we’d all scream and laugh. I put my ear to the door and imagine it’s him. Then I plop down at the table and open my laptop. I see rubber plants casting fleshy shadows on the chessboard, ferns falling out of baskets. It’s nice here but I wonder if Daddy misses the wet bar in marble he installed in Mommy’s apartment, the chandelier dripping golden light onto the mahogany dining table, his orange chair and hassock where he’d sit with his feet up readingOmni and eating croutons from a box.\r\n\r\nI have six new emails. One from Kojo Annan who keeps writing me. This time he goes straight to the point and claims to be the son of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. He wants me to assist him in moving whole funds abroad (sixty million dollars) and he will split it with me 40%/60%. He gives his word as a business man. I have other friends. Viagra Man and Mrs. Helen Amed of Kuwait City who is fifty-six and dying and a major oil tycoon. And Senator Patrick Osakwe in the Federal Republic of Nigeria who discovered an abandoned fifteen million United States Dollars. There is Mr. Cherokee Lawrence who deals on raw material. None of them can spell and I find their broken words endearing. If I get bored with them I may listen to Daddy’s tapes that come with the breast development kits, a special cream that causes full plump nipples or Stephanie Anne Lloyd’s voice lessons for transsexuals and transvestites. I need to accept Daddy as a she. I have to let go. I can’t hang onto the pronoun him much longer. But I don’t want to call him Mommy or Mom. He’ll have to be Kim.\r\n\r\nGrandma Lorna breaks from her spot before the bathroom mirror and strolls into the living room carrying a compact so as not to lose sight of herself. “I’m starved, Kim,” she lisps. “I’ll buy.” She’s wearing another pair of stretched out gray pants and her bra.\r\n\r\nDaddy bounces out of the second bathroom and for an instant I think it’s him. Old Daddy. But it’s the new Daddy in black Baha pants. He’s taken off Carmen and there’s his naked head in all its glory. No hair plugs or transplants or hormones could grow him new foliage, and the Velcro strips that wigs and hairpieces stick too are glued onto his scalp like Band-Aids. His pretty face is tanned but his head shines white as the bottle of saline nasal mist he’s spraying into his nostril. I can’t help but think of ligers and lijaguleps, first a jaguar and leopard crossed, and then the offspring, a jagleop, mated with a lion. I think of genetic leaks, species boundaries, sparse manes, spots too close together, sterility.\r\n\r\n“Forget it, Ma, I’m buying. Dalloway will go to the Golden Chicken & Ribs and pick up three chicken box dinners.”\r\n\r\n“Daddy, is that all I am to you—an errand girl?” I say, typing in “Dear Kojo, Please send particulars about how I can help you to move funds abroad.”\r\n\r\nI hit send.\r\n\r\n“Dalloway, you’re the genius in the family. My sun rises and sets on you. You are my arms and legs,” he winks, kissing the top of my eyebrow. Then he hands me a hundred dollar bill. “Three four-piece chicken dinners and you keep the change.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t eat chicken, Daddy, you know that.”\r\n\r\nI click on my next unopened message. This one from Barrister Ugo Bueze in El Salvadore contacting me to kindly assist him in a project of mutual benefit.\r\n\r\n“Since when?” He reddens under his tan and his lips pull back into a grimace. “What will you eat? Tofu and alfalfa sprouts? Has your mother Chairman Mao completely brain washed you?”\r\n\r\n“Chickens are toxic,” I say, letting Daddy know that factory broilers are injected with antibiotics, steroids, and hormones. I click yes to open new mail. The barrister wants to represent me as bona fide next of kin in the recovery of earthquake money. His grammar isn’t fractured enough to interest me. I hit delete.\r\n\r\n“Ma, did you hear that? Dalloway’s afraid of eating chicken. What, do you know how many hours you had to work to afford a chicken in 1919? One hundred and nineteen hours. Do you know how long you have to work to afford a chicken in 2005? Come on, Dalloway, you’re the fact checker here. How long?”\r\n\r\n“Twenty minutes.”\r\n\r\n“Fifteen minutes. We’re eating the cheapest foods in history.”\r\n\r\n“Why should chickens have to be murdered to fill the guts of greedy selfish people? So chefs would have something to pour cream sauce over? So you could leave half your lemon chicken because you’re dieting that night?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve never left chicken on my plate. Do you hear that, Ma? Dalloway cares more about chickens than human beings. You’re worse than your mother. Chairman Mao, Jr. is standing before me.”\r\n\r\n“Dalloway’s a real cutie,” Grandma Lorna says. “She’s my kiddo. Takes after her grandmother. She has my brain.”\r\n\r\nI want to stay cool, but my hair feels like it’s coming loose at the roots. If I get angry I lose. “How about those passengers on cruise ships who toss Bics overboard for the albatrosses to swallow? I suppose that’s fine by you?”\r\n\r\n“You’re going to get a reputation as a zealot,” he tells me, shifting the saline mist to another nostril. “Better stop or you’ll be branded at school. You’re a genius, Dalloway, but you don’t have to be a nut case. Don’t throw your brains away.”\r\n\r\nThey’re finding albatrosses that have starved to death because the plastic lighters won’t digest and the birds feel full. I can’t tell Daddy how badly I feel about the birds that come to me in dreams because he’ll accuse me of being a double zealot. Nothing is worse.\r\n\r\n“You get such good sun here, Kim,” says Grandma Lorna as she walks over to the west window and draws the mini-blinds looking out at the view of the Hess Gas Station and Kankahan Deli. “How is that chicken prepared? Pete, you know I don’t like skin.”\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nThe Golden Chicken & Ribs smells of blood, but it’s the barbecue sauce bubbling in a gigantic can on the grill. Broilers sizzle on the pit and orange grease beads on thighs and legs. I watch the cook dip a toilet bowl brush in the can and bring it out dripping to swab the ribs.\r\n\r\n“Two chicken box lunches to go,” I say. “Beans and pita bread.”\r\n\r\nI think of the cages where the chickens live from lights on to lights out, debeaked and wings clipped. Who hasn’t seen the video of chickens being tortured by poultry workers? “Do you know that millions of chickens are scalded alive in tanks of boiling water every year?” I ask the Latin boy who is lifting a drumstick off the grill with tongs and letting the juice trickle off.\r\n\r\nHe shrugs. “Everything’s got to die.” Flames spatter up. “Your boyfriend is trying to get your attention.”\r\n\r\n“What?” I turn, startled.\r\n\r\nA man carrying a bouquet of flowers is outside staring into the Golden Chicken. His blue eyes seem riveted by the sight of cooking chickens. His gaze moves to the vat of farting mashed potatoes, and then he looks up and smiles at something over my head. There is something familiar about him.\r\n\r\n“I’ve never seen that man before,” I tell the boy, and then I can’t seem to help myself. “Chickens are able to problem solve. They understand recently hidden objects still exist.” I pull out the hundred-dollar bill and pretend not to notice the sign. No bills bigger than 50s. “It’s all I have.”\r\n\r\n“Okay, okay,” the Latin counter boy says, lifting the hundred-dollar bill to the light.\r\n\r\nI imagine lying headless on the grill and the counter boy turning my legs with giant thongs. Would grease from my meat make a popping sound? Then 1931 Berlin pops into my head. Lone genius Konrad Zuse invented a computer but was ignored. I want to develop synthetic meat and end the slaughter of the innocents. Don’t cows, pigs, chickens, turkeys have a right to their own lives? What about the lives of violets?\r\n\r\nThe boy waves the toilet bowl brush at the window. “He’s still waiting for you. Lucky guy.”\r\n\r\nThe man is definitely staring at something. Maybe he’s checking out the hundred dollar bill. Maybe he’s looking for a box of money like Mrs. Helen Amed.\r\n\r\nI slide the bag with two box suppers over my forearm and I step outside. The man leaning against the window looks like Jude Law with hungry blue eyes. His blondish hair is combed flat as belly-skin to his head, his cheekbones jut. Maybe he’s starving, that’s why his mouth is wet from peeping at the chickens. I wonder who knotted his long skinny tie and folded the handkerchief into his lapel. I want to offer him a ten-spot when I walk past him, but at the last minute I can’t. I stop at Good-N-Plenty for vegetarian pizza, and find myself wondering if any human being’s mouth opens wider than Jude Law’s. Is that why everyone thinks he’s such a good actor? When he’s supposed to feel anger or sadness he howls stretching out his elastic mouth. But I’m not fooled. And when he kisses the love interest it looks more like he’s chewing their lips. I hope that if I ever kiss I won’t make that smacking sound that couples in movies do. Like their lips and tongues have peanut butter all over them. Like the bathtub suction is taking the last swirl of saliva. Like they are greedy and haven’t eaten for weeks. The more smacking the more you love.\r\n\r\nI head down 43rd Street and the Jude Law guy isn’t far behind. I pass Manhattan Towers and jaywalk across the street to Buckley’s Funeral Home. No fat Mr. Buckley stands in the window checking out the street through stained glass made from colored tissue paper. I push my face against the window and squint. The casket is a long blue shadow thrown over the linoleum floor. I make myself laugh and pick up the pace to Daddy’s apartment. Jude must live close by. He’s turning off the sidewalk and following me to the double door entrance. Since I’ve never seen him before and Daddy invites everyone in the building to Sunday brunches, this guy must have just moved in. Jude’s hands aren’t as full as mine yet I unlock the door and hold it open for him. He marches into the lobby and waits for me to hit the button before stepping into the elevator. I push the fourth floor and wonder when he will reach across to punch his floor button. I scent the flowers—lilies and red dahlias rusty as old plumbing. Then I notice an ant on the baby’s breath, and looking down see an ant crawling up the man’s pants. It’s a blue pant leg shiny from being worn. His moist red mouth is smiling sadly at a place over my head. The elevator dings as we pass the second and third floors.\r\n\r\n“Hello,” he says, and I hear an accent. The Black Forest. Tales of the Vienna Woods.\r\n\r\nShould I answer? But I’m invisible. He must be following the smell of grilled chicken. I can feel grease leaking from the box and through the bag onto my hands.\r\n\r\n“These flowers are for you.”\r\n\r\nI shiver. “Huh?”\r\n\r\nThe doors open and I step out of the elevator and so does he. I feel like I’m wading. I slide the key into the lock but it’s not the right one and my fingers fumble, smeared with chicken fat. He’s right behind me and his odor is overpowering. Not terrible just strong. Like a whole slough of stems rotting in water. Like when they pull a building down and open the cellar to air for the first time in ninety years.\r\n\r\nDoes he have a knife in the flowers? Is he pulling it out now? I almost call out for Daddy.\r\n\r\n“Wait, don’t go away,” he says in that frail voice.\r\n\r\nI glance at his too bright eyes. “I have to go in now. My father lives here.”\r\n\r\n“I am giving these flowers to the girl with true beauty. I’ve searched to find you.”\r\n\r\nMy head feels too big for my neck. “What is beauty?”\r\n\r\nHe keeps holding out the weed bouquet. “You have true beauty,” he repeats and wedges the bouquet between the box chicken dinners and into my arms.\r\n\r\nThe door swings open and Daddy stands there in his jogging outfit, his mouth hitting the floor. The man with the flowers backs down the hall to the fire door. He bows slightly before turning the knob.\r\n\r\n“Dalloway, get inside the apartment,” Daddy says, gritting his teeth. “Who is that guy?” His hand with the orange flame fingernails reaches for me, his whole body quivering except for his breasts. Who would believe gummy bear silicon is solid as stone?\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” I answer, the stick flowers scratching my cheek as he pulls me into the apartment and slams the door, putting his eye to the peephole.\r\n\r\n“You were talking to him right outside the door.”\r\n\r\nI shrug. “So what? Daddy, please take some of this stuff from me. He followed me from Golden Chicken. What could I do about it?”\r\n\r\nDaddy shouts, “Where are your survival skills, Dalloway? You’re supposed to be the gifted child here. Why didn’t you ring the buzzer and give the signal? Never let anyone follow you into a building. Never get into an elevator with some pervert. He could have killed you.” He jerks out one of his plastic storage drawers rummaging inside for his scuba knife, digging until he finds his stun gun and mace. He tests the stunner, and a single bolt of crooked blue-white lightning almost strikes the floor. Right now old Daddy is in charge. Like the days when we prepared for a wilderness adventure.\r\n\r\nGrandma Lorna takes the chicken box lunches from me. She lifts the top box, sets it on the counter. “Was he good-looking? Too young for me?” she asks before picking up a drumstick. “Dalloway, how’s your mother doing?” She bites into the chicken, flecks of black skin sticking to her lips.\r\n\r\n“Ma, get on the phone and call 911. I’m going after him.”\r\n\r\n“Daddy, just leave him alone. He didn’t hurt me.”\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nNaked Lunch is that moment when you see what is on the end of everyone’s fork. I want to turn away from Daddy’s teeth tearing flesh. And Ponce de Leon Grandma with her face of tri-colored pasta salad insists on champagne with her box dinner. “Here’s to you, Joe,” Grandma Lorna sighs. “I miss you.” Grandpa Joe died nine months ago. I liked him. He was only an inch taller than me and wore two-tone aviator glasses, his eyes peeking out like disciples. Hard to believe he had Mafia connections as Grandma Lorna claims. I remember last Christmas, his beret topped with a pompom. Grandma Lorna had belted his camel-colored overcoat and wrapped the muffler around his neck like a child overdressed for sledding; only this boy was withered and carried an oxygen tank. “Oh, he always takes nitro before coitus,” Grandma Lorna said to the guests.\r\n\r\nI excuse myself from the table. Can I go get some air up on the roof? I let Daddy load me down with binoculars and his cell phone. “Call me,” he insists, “if you spot that crazy guy anywhere.” Nine billion chickens raised to become broilers, chickens prodded to gorge until they’re so fat their bones break. What’s crazier?\r\n\r\nI climb the stairs to the tar roof and check out the Midtown view. The Empire State Building, its tower lit red white and blue like a Bombpop Popsicle is shrouded in black clouds. At the Park-N-Shop across the street, a car alarm is going off. I cross to the river side. Sometimes Daddy comes up with his set of binoculars and we surf the windows in the high-rises like we’re taking a long drive in the country. I rest my elbows on the ledge. There’s the neon blinking Edelweiss, the bar & grill hole in the wall that serves greasy sauerkraut. I look through the binoculars. Prostitutes swim under the streetlights. Cars from New Jersey, drivers cruising girls almost naked in the heat. They’re beautiful and there she is. The blond waif in transparent underwear and pink fishnets. She looks fourteen. Her legs are wishbones. Her breasts, two nipples, almost a boy’s chest. Daddy and I have seen her before. “Hey, I see our hooker,” he would say if he was here. “I wonder what it would be like to be her. To do what she does.”\r\n\r\nMe too. I wonder what it would be like to be her for five minutes. Especially the approach part when you walk up to a car. I think about a vacation when Daddy took us to the Jersey Shore to eat at a fancy oyster bar. The fillet of amberjack lay on the plate dressed in lemon slices and capers, but I saw marks of the grill burned into the flesh. I wanted to press my lips to the fish. Instead Daddy cut it and fed me and Mommy, rolling the capers into our mouths. Then he asked Mommy if she ever thought about being a hooker. She slapped his face with her linen napkin. “How dare you say that in front of your daughter?” Mommy fumed. “Maybe you want that for yourself.” Daddy stood his ground, “I was just talking, Chairman Mao. But sometimes it seems hookers are free.”\r\n\r\nThrough the binoculars I watch the waif move away from the streetlights toward the car. There are two men in the front seat, someone in back, and a rack on top of the car. I keep focused on her bubble of kinky Orphan Annie hair as she takes her tiny pigeon steps. She appears totally unclothed as if her pink underwear has evaporated. A girl who could sneak into a room in a baseball hat and t-shirt and not be seen, but with a roll of her eyes, turn humid as marmalade. Not a Godiva chocolate but a Kit-Kat. Then the man in the passenger’s seat gets out of the car. He has the ropy body of a drug dealer. She stops. Don’t get in, I tell her in my mind. He probably wants her to get in the middle. No way, I hope she’s saying. She isn’t going to be boxed in, not this girl who loves Godzilla videos. But there’s no arguing with these guys, these rebuilt fuel pumps.\r\n\r\nThe driver jumps out, pulling her into the car. I can hear the ambulances from St. Claire’s. Now I can’t find her, they must have pushed her down, then her frizzy halo of hair bobs up and one of them raises his fist and smacks her. It feels different and the same like TV. Only girls usually don’t get hit in the face right before your eyes, you only see their gutted blue bodies.\r\n\r\nWhat is the ropy man doing? He hits her again. Keeps slugging her. Stop it, better stop. I race for the stairs, take them three at a time, jumping, knowing I have to get to her while she still has a face.\r\n\r\nMy body trembles and it feels like the stairs are buckling and I’m a clouded leopard, the smallest of the big cats, I’m a male lynx and female bobcat, I’m a blynx.\r\n\r\nDown the last flight of stairs and through the security doors out into the black fumes and sirens. “Georgio,” a woman calls out. These are the streets between Tenth and Eleventh Avenues that Daddy has forbid me to walk on by myself. I smell the dull shit odor of huskies and poodles, rottweilers and dachshunds, in every state of softening and hardening. Turds ricochet off my sneakers. I run past the Bangladesh souvenir storeowner and his battery-operated spiders. There’s a man facing a car relieving himself. Between the rock buildings and the river are stretches of wilderness, a bridge with shattered railroad tracks. Night has come, but it’s not real dark. The heavens are grey like an elevator shaft that the moon has stumbled into. I’m running now. Dalloway, stop, honey, no run, honey. I hear Grandma Lorna with her Kim, Pete, Kim, Pete. I wonder if I’ll be able to make out the license plate. Black. Michigan maybe. My long legs are pumping ready for the home sprint toward the car.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nI’m running into street light and then out, toward the car with the carrier on the roof, the car of murky waters, car that is a coffin, carrying no white orchids, no friends to call at chapel. I have my binoculars and I’ll swing them at the car of gap-tooth meanness, men from South Bronx or South Tennessee, back seats where they stuff girls. I won’t let them tear up her face. As I round the corner I whiff the river, its cheap perfume. But the car isn’t there. I’m panting. Then I see her curled up on the sidewalk, tinier, younger, and pale-skinned like dirty cream, one shoe off, one of those girls you can spit on if you like.\r\n\r\n“Are you okay?” I say. “I saw them.” Then she lifts her head and turns and I see the marks in her cheek where they hit her. She’s holding her mouth and nose like everything inside her face is loose. “Are you okay?” I ask again. She’s not silky-fine. Coarse. Not a bird like I thought with bones so light they would have to be hollow.\r\n\r\nThen she holds up her hand and it says stop because her hand is red with nose bleed. “Don’t mix in this. Your kind causes trouble.” We look at each other as if there’s a continental divide between us. Farther than the Upper East Side of Manhattan is from Paterson, New Jersey, farther than soymilk and seven-grain-bread is from Diet Mountain Dew and Little Debbie’s. I take another step toward her where the asphalt has loosened and bits of tinfoil and glass crunch, the distance between pre-approved credit and low auto rates, Unitarians and gospel believers. How long is eternity? If you ground down every building in this city and a pigeon flew it to the moon piece by piece. Eternity is longer. Here the city is pure, no flowers to hum, no breathing gardenias, just this.\r\n\r\n“You’ve taken your fill of gawking, now git,” she says, struggling to get up, a string of blood hanging from her chin.\r\n\r\nShe glares at me as if she knows out in the wild my hybrid kind starve. I’m a leopon, made by a lioness who produces cubs that climb trees like their leopard father. I’m a tigon.\r\n\r\nBut it is she who gits. I watch her hobble down the street, kicking off her remaining shoe. I am in the sexiest address in the world, the zip code of all the Chop-o-Matics.\r\n\r\nI feel four-legged, all flank and spine.

(17, 'Turning the Bones', 'Jillian and I are sitting on the hard-packed earth in front of a large fire, the flames illuminating the faces of the others in the circle. The air is saturated with the smell of spice, strong coffee and sweat. I wipe my brow with a handkerchief and smile nervously at anyone who looks at me. This is their ritual, their world, and Jillian and I are only vazaha, foreigners.\r\n\r\nTo my left is our guide, Razaranohira. We call him Raza for short, and he doesn’t seem to mind. He grins and shows his teeth, and I wonder how they can be so straight and white when everything around him is crooked and dirty.\r\n\r\n“They are asking the ancestors for forgiveness,” he says.\r\n\r\nHis English is good. He interprets the words of some of the family members who are part of the Merina tribe, the largest tribe in Madagascar and one of the several who practice the ritual of famadihana, the turning of the bones, that we are now witnessing.\r\n\r\nBefore we left for our trip to this village, Raza prepared a document to show to the chief when we arrived. It explained in Malagasy who we were, how long we would stay, and that we wanted to observe. At least that is what Raza told us, and I have to trust him, as my Malagasy is very weak. I know only ten words, includingazafady (please) and misaotra (thank you).\r\n\r\nWe are enveloped by the shadows of gray stone cubes, the family tombs. In rows surrounding the perimeter of the tombs are hundreds of upturned zebu horns, their sharp points glinting white in the firelight. It was just yesterday that Jillian and I saw our first zebu out the tour bus window. We gawked at the huge hump on their backs and their pendulous ears. They were not at all like the cattle we have back in the states. The horns around the grave are remnants of past celebrations and a sign of the family’s wealth. Nothing like the manicured cemeteries Jillian and I are accustomed to. No plastic roses, no carved angels.\r\n\r\nBut, to the Malagasy, these stark tombs are like luxury hotels for the dead. I remember the Malagasy man sitting next to me on our flight to the capital city of Antananarivo. He carried a cupful of earth in a plastic bag and explained to Jillian and me that it was from his family tomb. If he died while he was abroad, he said carrying the dirt would increase his chances of being returned to the tomb to be buried. “Earth wants to return to its home,” he said and waved the bag at me.\r\n\r\nSuperstitions like this are common here, and taboos, known as fady, run rampant in every tribe. Jillian and I have been warned by the locals not to touch a pig with a stub tail, as it will bring poverty. If we cut any branches from the sacred tree by the river, we will be forced to find a rooster with black spots to sacrifice. I have been told that if a dog pees on a tomb, it must be killed. But it is also fady to kill a dog. It’s very confusing and best left out of the hands of the vazaha.\r\n\r\nJillian turns to Raza and asks, “Why do they need the ancestor’s forgiveness?”\r\n\r\n“Because the rice won’t grow. The ancestor must be angry at the family for something they have done.”\r\n\r\nThis is the first night of the three-day famidahana, and the party is in full swing. Some of the family members are dancing at a frantic pace to music from drums and bamboo flutes. The men, women and children all wearlambas that look like togas draped around their bodies and adding a gaudy burst of color to the backdrop of the gray tombs. The men share glass bottles of toka-gosh, crude rum made from rice and sugar cane. I have been warned that it is highly potent and do not want to lose control among strangers, so Jillian and I drink bland, rice tea.\r\n\r\nShe is tilting back her head to swallow the last of her tea and reaches for more. We are parched from our day at the Perinet Reserve, the destination of our nearly 10,000 mile journey to get up close and personal with lemurs. Jillian loved the furry creatures. She cooed at them and snapped pictures while I watched from a distance. A friend told me lemurs carry rabies. Jillian crouched down, “so they aren’t scared,” she said. She offered her granola bar, and I told her she shouldn’t feed wild animals.\r\n\r\nI had been more enamored of the chameleons. Slowly inching along a branch, watching me no matter where I went, one eye fixed straight ahead and the other rotating up, down, side to side, following my movements. I tried running forward and backward, hid behind a tree, but there was always one eye focused on me. When I got too close to one, its body changed color from a muted green to a fiery red, and I took that as a sign that I had gone too far. Jillian was uninterested, told me I lacked subtlety when approaching animals, so I sulked along behind her and the lemurs.\r\n\r\nRaza is singing now with the rest of the family. The women sing a high verse, a lilting melody, while the men come in underneath with a low, steady accompaniment. Of course I cannot understand the words, but it sounds light-hearted, cheerful almost, and I find myself humming. When the song stops, I ask Raza, “Are you related?”\r\n\r\n“Most in the village are related,” he says. “I am a cousin.”\r\n\r\n“Did others travel far to get here?” I ask. I have seen how treacherous the travel can be and think they must have known about this event far in advance.\r\n\r\n“They are already here,” he answers. “Where else would they be?”\r\n\r\nI am distracted by a man in a yellow lamba walking from person to person with a platter of meat. Jillian looks at the meat for just a moment before taking a piece. I am afraid of what it might be, although it has the familiar look of beef. Brown, slightly bloodied. I have read in the travel guide about bilharzia, hepatitis, even bubonic plague. Malaria is an ever-present danger from the swarms of mosquitoes, but we are already taking pills to prevent that. I want to coat my digestive track with aw thick layer of metal, or forgo food altogether and live on the rest of my granola bars and filtered water for the remainder of the trip.\r\n\r\n“Zebu,” Raza says and pops a chunk into his mouth.\r\n\r\n“Take some,” Jillian says. “Don’t be rude.”\r\n\r\nI place it on my tongue and chew quickly before swallowing. It tastes like regular steak. I look again at the garden of horns blooming around the tomb and think of the zebu that die for these parties.\r\n\r\nI lean toward Jillian and raise my voice above the singing that has started again. “What do they do when they kill all their cattle?” I ask. “What do they eat?”\r\n\r\nShe shrugs. I take more zebu.\r\n\r\nI wonder how long Jillian would fare in this land of wooden shacks and mud huts. Would she learn to carry a sack of rice on her head? She looks somewhat rugged in her khaki pants and hiking boots. But despite two pairs of socks, she is nursing a blister on her pinkie toe. This morning, I helped her scratch the price tag sticker off the bottom of her stiff, leather boots. She should have worked them in weeks ago back at home but insisted on saving her new outfits (and boots) until we arrived at our destination. In retrospect, a poor idea.\r\n\r\nAs for me, I can’t imagine ever learning to carry anything on my head. My skull is too pointy. Besides, I wouldn’t be able to handle living for long without modern conveniences. The lodge we are staying at is no Hilton, but it’s comfortable. We sleep in soft beds. We ride in clean buses, so unlike the dangerously crowded and dusty taxi-brousses we’ve seen careening through the countryside. It is worth the extra cost to have booked a package tour. And, the money was of no real consequence to me. The law firm where I work is doing well, and I hope to make partner next year, the youngest the firm has ever had.\r\n\r\nUntil I met Jillian, I was having a hard time finding things to spend my money on. In desperation, I bought a towel warmer and robotic lawnmower, the kinds of things you find in the catalogs on airplanes. Now, I spend money on her, anything she wants, even if it’s to go halfway around the world to satisfy a lemur fascination.\r\n\r\nI admit I had to look up Madagascar in my atlas. I gazed at the large chunk of island with Africa to its west and the wide expanse of Indian Ocean to its east. Jillian and I had been surfing channels when we found a National Geographic show about lemurs. I learned how much she loved them, and I learned that when she gets excited about something, her eyes crinkle up and start to get teary in the corners.\r\n\r\nIn the past six months that I have known her, I have learned that she sleeps in boxer shorts and an old T-shirt. That she prefers red wine to white. I have not learned how her mother died, only that she did, just before we met, and that Jillian refuses to talk about it. “Too painful still,” she says. I had hoped this trip would help her to forget.\r\n\r\nThe turning of the bones. It is not a place to bring a woman, not even a woman like Jillian who seems ready and willing to handle new situations. I never thought she would want to attend a ceremony so connected with the one topic she’s trying hard to suppress. But, Raza’s description of the famidahana had captivated her. We met him standing outside the lodge where he was chewing on a piece of sugar cane. He had on a red shirt that said Nike in black letters, probably a cast-off from a well-meaning church group in the states.\r\n\r\nRaza is one of the nature reserve guides. Yesterday, he took us to a prime spot to observe the sun-worshipping sifaka lemurs. We watched as they sat up on their haunches and outstretched their arms, turning up their snouts into the morning air and letting the sunlight warm their furry, white bellies. He explained thefamidahana to us on our hike back to the lodge. I had reservations about trespassing on such an important ceremony, was scared that we might be harmed. Jillian was not concerned and convinced Raza to allow us to attend as guests, for a price of course.\r\n\r\n“I want to immerse myself in the culture,” she had said.\r\n\r\nJillian grabs my arm and points toward the tomb. Out of the square of darkness that is its opening, I see one of the older men walking. He moves slowly, deliberately, and clutches to his breast a bundle in a faded, yellow cloth frayed at the edges.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” I whisper, and Jillian shushes me.\r\n\r\nA woman unrolls a multi-colored woven mat over the ground, and the man gently lays the bundle on top. He takes a corner of the cloth and slowly unravels it, revealing a bone. For a moment, I mistake it for more zebu horns, until I see the skull with gaping eye sockets and the hollow rib cage. I recoil at first, expecting to see scraps of skin and hair, to smell the rot that I assume would come from a dead body.\r\n\r\nBut there is nothing. The bones are stripped clean. The man arranges them in the proper order. It isn’t hard because many of them are still connected. The hand, for example, is still intact. I can’t help but think of the plastic model skeleton hanging in my high school science class. There is no horror movie gore here. It’s sanitary almost, yet I feel an uneasiness growing underneath my fascination. This is no plastic model. This is—was—an actual person, and he is just lying there on the other side of the fire.\r\n\r\nRaza told us the corpse would be brought out and present during the ceremony, so we should not be surprised. But still I look at it in utter amazement. Jillian, too, appears enthralled. We glance once at each other, then quickly back to the bones.\r\n\r\nI whisper to her, “Pretty weird, huh?”\r\n\r\nShe answers, “I don’t think we’d see anything like it in Chicago.”\r\n\r\nShe’s right. We have no dead in Chicago. Jillian’s mother, both of my own parents, not dead, just on extended vacation, or so it seems. I saw them of course, my parents. Lying in two mahogany coffins after their car crash three years ago. I had managed to avoid looking in coffins before, but there is no avoiding it when it’s your own parents. Well-meaning friends and relatives practically pushed me up to it, thinking that somehow seeing them in this unnatural state would heal the grief. My parents looked like wax mannequins. The stretched skin and molded mouths, straight lips. No smile, no frown. Indifferent. My mother in make-up that she never would have worn in public. The pink rouged cheeks, the eye shadow with tiny, iridescent flecks. My father in his best suit, worn previously at other people’s funerals.\r\n\r\nI touched my mother’s hand, and the skin felt rubbery under my fingers. I felt nothing and wondered why, but now I know that I really couldn’t believe it was her. I’m waiting for my parents to return from vacation, from the Bahamas maybe, or a cruise to Alaska.\r\n\r\nStill, I have visited their graves. Once. Which is more than most people do. Most people are on the other side of the country from their dead. Out of sight, out of mind. When I went to the cemetery, I stood and looked at their names carved in the granite. I observed that the lawn had been recently mowed. Many of the other graves had flowers, which I did not bring. I didn’t know whom I would be bringing them for. The man who mows the lawn? The other families who come to visit? Surely not my parents, if they were even in there. I had watched the coffins sink down into the earth with those wax mannequins inside.\r\n\r\nThere is no coffin here at the famidahana, no line in the sand between me and the dead man. I have never been this close to death without a barrier of daffodil arrangements. I watch a girl dressed in a bright blue lambaapproach the bones with short, timid steps. She is young, perhaps only sixteen. She bows, deposits a plate of rice and zebu meat on the ground. The rest of the family is seated in the circle, doing some type of chant in harmony, similar to the song before but not as melodious. The girl takes hold of the edge of the shroud and tears off a small square. The fabric is old and worn, and it tears easily. She brings the piece of cloth to her mouth and eats it. I jostle Raza out of his chant.\r\n\r\n“What is she doing, Raza? Why is she eating that?” I ask.\r\n\r\n“Does she have to eat the whole thing?” Jillian says, her eyes wide.\r\n\r\nRaza laughs at us, stupid vazaha, and shakes his head. “The woman has not been able to bear children,” he says. “Eating the shroud will help.”\r\n\r\nI hear Jillian make a disapproving clucking in her throat.\r\n\r\n“Eating cloth does not cure infertility,” she whispers to me. She is intent on watching the girl chew and swallow, as if she wants to make sure it’s not some kind of magic trick.\r\n\r\nI suddenly have an urge to know if Jillian wants children. I lean in close to talk into her ear over the chanting. “What if you were infertile and the only way to get pregnant was to eat some dead guy’s clothes?” I ask.\r\n\r\nShe rolls her eyes. “I’m not eating anyone’s clothes, ever,” she says. “Although my mom would have been all for it. She wanted me to get the husband first, though, then the kids. If there was some kind of cloth I could have eaten to get a husband and kids, she would have been stuffing me with it, with a side of mashed potatoes.”\r\n\r\nI laugh at her and put a hand on her knee. “How’s your blister?” I ask.\r\n\r\n“It’s okay, I guess. I wadded up some Kleenex and stuffed them around my toe.”\r\n\r\nWe’re both looking down at her boot when the family starts getting up from the circle around us. An older woman walks over to the bones and sets a wooden bowl in front of them. As the crowd files past, they all place some kind of offering in the bowl, the red and green Franc Malgache bills, dishes of rice and bottles of rum and wine to nourish the person in the after-life.\r\n\r\nJillian jerks her head toward my pocket, so I pull out my wallet, take out some Franc Malgache equivalent to twenty American dollars. It is a month’s earnings for some here, but only if they’re wealthy. Jillian links arms with me, and we walk together up to the bones with Raza at our side. The village chief starts speaking to us in Malagasy, and I shake my head to indicate I can’t understand. Raza says our names to the chief, Jillian Brandt, Joseph Roth. The chief turns his attention to the bones and speaks in Malagasy again. Between the words I don’t understand, he repeats our names.\r\n\r\nRaza says to us, “He is introducing you. You are not family, so the dead man does not know you.”\r\n\r\nI nod, and Jillian and I look at the bones, at the man we are being introduced to. For a brief moment, I feel the urge to take his bony hand and shake it, lifting it into the air while the rest of the body lies on the ground. When the chief is done speaking, I place my money into the bowl, and he gives me a broad smile when he sees it. I shrug as if to say, “it’s nothing.”\r\n\r\nWhen we return to our spot on the ground, I ask Raza what they will do with the money.\r\n\r\nHe says, “It goes back to the tomb. It will keep the spirit happy.”\r\n\r\nI cannot believe that the family will let this treasure be sealed away with someone who can’t use it. They’re so poor. It just doesn’t make sense.\r\n\r\n“Does anyone ever break into the tomb?” I ask. “To steal the money?”\r\n\r\nRaza gives me a puzzled look. “No one would dishonor the dead.”\r\n\r\nEveryone has given their donations and is sitting back around the fire, talking in small groups and drinking rum. Some people are lying flat on their backs, dozing off. Raza gets up to talk to someone, and Jillian and I stretch out our legs and get as comfortable as we can on the hard ground.\r\n\r\n“I guess if this thing goes on for three days, there has to be some downtime,” I say.\r\n\r\n“I suppose,” Jillian says. “Is it what you expected?”\r\n\r\nI shake my head, bewildered, and look at the stack of bones and the offerings next to it. A piece of red silk is lying on the ground nearby, which Raza said will replace the fraying material that the bones had been wrapped in.\r\n\r\nJillian asks, “What if I could see my mom again or you could see your parents?”\r\n\r\n“Like this?” I say. “You mean, we’d be like gravediggers or something?”\r\n\r\n“Of course not. We’d be arrested!” Jillian says.\r\n\r\nI imagine myself with a shovel and lantern, fog lying close to the ground, digging up my parents’ graves. At least I would know they were in there. Shortly after they died, I saw a movie where the main character faked his death and moved away, assuming a false identity. What if the whole thing had been a sham? My parents are off in Hawaii with new names, drinking fruity concoctions with umbrellas under a hibiscus bush.\r\n\r\nJillian says, “I just wish I could see my mom again.”\r\n\r\nI put my arm around her and squeeze her around the waist. “I think it’s pretty normal to want to bring the dead back to life, at least if you had a good relationship with them when they were living,” I say. “There’s always something we forgot to tell them.”\r\n\r\n“What’s that thing for you? What did you forget to tell your parents?”\r\n\r\nI look into the fire and think about this for a moment. “I should have told them that I broke the lamp in our living room when I was ten. I told them it was my cousin, and he ended up getting in trouble.”\r\n\r\nJillian starts laughing loudly. Raza looks over at us and smiles and laughs too, as if he’s in on our joke.\r\n\r\n“That’s what you would want to tell them?” she says. “I was thinking it would be something a little more profound.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what would you say?”\r\n\r\n“I would just tell my mom how much I love her and that she was a great mom, even though we didn’t always get along. She was great. That’s it.”\r\n\r\nI was hoping for something more profound, too, but I don’t tell her this. I bring my arm up around her shoulder and tug at one of her curls and wonder how her toe feels and wonder if we’ll make love when we get back to the lodge or if she’ll be too sleepy.\r\n\r\nWe are silent for awhile and I notice my stomach starting to feel upset. I wonder about the zebu meat and how it was prepared.\r\n\r\nOne of the men on the other side of the fire stands up and staggers a bit, feet heavy with rum. He begins to sing and raises his arms to the musicians, rousing them to action. They comply and take their flutes and drums in hand, matching the man’s singing with a fast-paced tempo.\r\n\r\nOthers start to stand and dance, jerking one leg up and then another. They shout and twirl, faces upturned to the sky. Jillian’s foot taps next to me, her boot thumping the dirt. In a moment, she too is standing, and Raza extends his arm to pull her into the circle of twitching bodies. I pull her in the other direction, grabbing at the leg of her shorts to try to get her to sit down. She jerks away and joins Raza, and I realize I’m the only one still seated. It makes me feel uncomfortable, like I’m wearing swim trunks on a nudist beach, so I stand.\r\n\r\nI take one hand and then the other out of my pockets. Jillian pulls me to her, and we are surrounded by the swirling reds, yellows, greens, and blues of the lambas. I look up, and all I see are arms flailing. I feel trapped underneath it all, like I’m underground and looking up into a sky of tree branches swaying in the wind. Then, Jillian takes my hands and clasps them. She raises both of our arms up over our heads and pokes through all those limbs, and I feel a rush of warm air against my knuckles. She presses her hips against mine, moving to the pulsing beat pounded out on the drums. She is smiling and sweaty and beautiful, and I start to feel my own body take over, sensing the rhythm from somewhere inside, from deep within my bones. I am humming again, and I can feel the drums in my chest. I lose myself, dancing like an idiot but not caring, smiling at Raza and his family.\r\n\r\nThe chief dances around the edge of the circle and is soon next to us. The whites of his eyes seem to glow in the firelight like the stacks of zebu horns. He is speaking to me in Malagasy again, and I look to Raza who says, “He is happy you have come.”\r\n\r\nI take the chief’s hand and shake it. “Misaotra,” I say. “Thank you.”', 'Marcy Campbell’s short fiction appears most recently in RE:AL and Sou’wester and new stories are forthcoming in Another Chicago Magazine and Parting Gifts.

(18, 'Samurai Bluegrass', 'Their harmonies teeter on the edge of sweetness and mournful whine. It’s that high lonesome sound. The bluegrass band enraptures the pierced patrons, their ghost-white faces tilt toward the stage. I’m sitting in the basement of the Apocalypse Club thinking of dogs carrying severed hands. It’s a scene from the Kurosawa movie I watched with my nephew Zack last weekend. I came here because Carol used to say bluegrass gets into your soul.\r\n\r\n“This is beee-zar,” says a guy next to me with a giant safety pin in his nose.\r\n\r\n“Reminds me of the Insect Gods,” says his tattooed girlfriend.\r\n\r\nI wonder if she means some band that played here last week—or if she’s into a weird religion that I don’t want to know about. I wondered why a punk club would book a bluegrass band. Maybe they were going for irony.\r\n\r\nThe band finishes the mournful tune and the violin rips a string of notes. These southern guys don’t care if they’re at the Grand Old Opry playing to bad suits and big hair or here, cutting tunes in a black basement, playing to a crowd of anorexic vampires. The vampires are eating it up. Then an image clicks in, another Japanese one. The bluegrass band exudes honour. They are Samurai warriors, pure, facing the darkness, full of courage and blood. Give the violin player a dye job and a sword and he’d be a dead ringer for Toshiro Mifune.\r\n\r\nTomorrow is Saturday—I’m supposed to pick up Zack in the morning. I walk upstairs and ask a pink haired girl the time. She sneers at me. A large Asian guy with a soul patch says, “Twelve-oh-four.” The numbers leave his mouth as he exhales a huge smoke ring.\r\n\r\nI close my eyes on the subway and roll these images of Samurai and dogs and bluegrass bands around in my head. Maybe there’s something to them, something I could paint. I think of other Kurosawa movies, and how they feel like westerns. I picture myself walking down a barren street, the wind snaps my kimono, I pull out this huge mother of a sword. The noon sun hits the blade and I squint into fiery light. The soundtrack is western of course, but not Bluegrass, more twangy. But who am I facing? I look down the street and all around me. There’s no one. It’s a ghost town.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nNext morning, I’m at my sister’s house by ten. Susan really appreciates the break. Zack’s a cool kid and I like hanging with him; it gets me doing something else. I used to go to a life drawing class on Saturdays, but I’m not drawing anything these days.\r\n\r\nWe walk to the subway, take it downtown, and hop on a streetcar. I watch Zack stare out the window. He just turned five, but he seems a lot older. I mistake it for maturity, but I know it’s not that. Maybe it’s that his dad is Chinese and he’s inherited Susan’s genes; she was the calm, peaceful one in our family. I decided to try and be a bigger influence on Zack after I lost Carol. We’d talked about having kids, but I said I wasn’t ready. I wanted to see if I could get my career going. I had a couple of galleries feigning interest; I thought I was getting close. Carol was supportive, but she’d gently remind me that we still needed to pay the rent.\r\n\r\nSusan started asking me to come to church after the accident. I said no for a few months. I didn’t want to hear about God being so good and answering prayers and sing happy hymns about him.\r\n\r\nOne night at Susan’s, I stayed up late drinking wine and talking. Stephen had put Zack down and, probably thinking he should leave us alone, he went to bed.\r\n\r\n“Jim, anger’s part of grief,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Not in the mood for this, Susan.”\r\n\r\n“It happens. We’re human.”\r\n\r\nI just shrugged. She was patient with me.\r\n\r\n“If there’s anything you need, we can help.”\r\n\r\n“There is something,” I started. “I’d like her back.”\r\n\r\nThat Sunday, I did go to church—more for Susan than anything. It neither bothered me nor soothed me. During the sermon, I nudged Zack and pulled a couple of faces. He giggled and Susan looked over at us. I thought I’d get the “this is serious, pay attention” look, but she just smiled. Stephen looked over and smiled at Zack, then me. He had thick hair like Zack’s, a couple of strands of white sparkled at his temples. I knew he and Susan were treating me with kid gloves.\r\n\r\nThe pastor was saying how parables were like an early form of movies.\r\n\r\nI looked over at Zack and whispered, “I wonder if he’s ever seen Yojimbo.”\r\n\r\nZack smiled, Susan looked at me and smiled again. Christ, I was bored.\r\n\r\nWe went for lunch after the service. The four of us shared a giant bowl of hot and sour soup. We ate in awkward silence until I asked Zack if he wanted to go to the art gallery on Saturday.\r\n\r\n“Okay.”\r\n\r\nMy sister liked that I was taking an interest in Zack.\r\n\r\n“Do you really want to take a five year old to the art gallery?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Sure. We’ll have a great time, hey, Zack?”\r\n\r\n“Yep,” Zack said and gave his little nod. His mop of black hair moved as one shape. At a glance, Zack looked fully Asian, except he had Susan’s pale blue eyes. A lot of people did a double-take when they saw those eyes.\r\n\r\n“Just keep him close, hang on to him, okay?”\r\n\r\n“Zack’s not going to wander off,” I said.\r\n\r\n“It’s not Zack I’m worried about.”\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nLast Saturday, Zack and I watched a Kurosawa movie. I told Zack I didn’t have any cartoons, but he could look at my collection and pick one out. I figured if he picked something really violent I’d suggest something else.\r\n\r\n“That’s a favorite of mine,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Why is it called Yojimbo?”\r\n\r\n“It means, Bodyguard.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” Zack said. “Who does he guard?”\r\n\r\n“Well, he used to guard a nobleman, someone rich, but now he doesn’t have anyone to guard.”\r\n\r\nZack looked at the picture. “He’s not Chinese.”\r\n\r\n“No, he’s Japanese. It has these words that go across the bottom so you can understand. You sure you want to watch this one?”\r\n\r\n“Okay.”\r\n\r\nWe get to the part where Toshiro Mifune tosses a long stick in the air.\r\n\r\n“Why does he do that? Is he lost?” Zack asked.\r\n\r\n“He’s just deciding which way to go.”\r\n\r\nZack didn’t say anything when the dog carrying the severed hand came on; he’s not the kind of kid that’d say eww, gross, or even be scared by it. Still, I decided to not tell Susan what we watched—she’s sensitive to that sort of stuff. That’s why she’s a better parent than I would have been. Carol would have been great, I know that.\r\n\r\nI had to stop the movie once in a while to tell Zack what was going on. He’s a pretty good reader for someone in kindergarten, but the subtitles went by fast and there were words he didn’t know.\r\n\r\nAbout halfway through, I thought Zack was getting bored. So, I shut off the movie and asked if he wanted to do something else.\r\n\r\n“Did you paint that?” he pointed to a painting in the corner of the room.\r\n\r\n“Yep.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“It’s not really supposed to look like anything.”\r\n\r\n“It’s sad.”\r\n\r\nIt was the one I’d painted right after the accident.\r\n\r\n“Do you have more?”\r\n\r\n“No, I’m not painting much right now,” I told him. I hadn’t drawn a line in months.\r\n\r\nZack nodded.\r\n\r\nI asked if he wanted something to eat. In the spirit of the film, I cooked up some Ramen and cut up little pieces of Chinese sweet meat and green onions.\r\n\r\n“Can we watch the rest?” Zack asked as he slurped up a long noodle.\r\n\r\nThat’s how I knew I could take Zack to the gallery. He was interested in everything; especially things he’d never seen before. He’d never watched a Japanese movie, or looked at a Monet up close. I’d read how Miro and Picasso were always trying to see how a kid sees—a time when everything in the world was fresh, a new sensory experience. That’s how it was with Zack. He peered through the holes of the Henry Moores like he was looking through an alien telescope, one that cast new light on the ordinary.\r\n\r\nI understood Susan’s concern about how I get distracted. The drift. It’s not some pretentious thing like the “artist’s mind”—but images often blow through my consciousness. In art school, I had an instructor that told us to shut off our interior monologue; shut off that part that says a tree looks like “this”; close that flow of information and start to really see. More than anything, drawing is about seeing.\r\n\r\nIn a room full of abstract expressionists, Zack points at a huge green canvas. “Is that a tree?” he asks.\r\n\r\n“Could be,” I say. “Is that what a tree looks like to you?”\r\n\r\n“Sometimes.”\r\n\r\nWe go into the impressionist wing, pastel colours swirl within gilded frames.\r\n\r\n“Hey, Zack, squint when you look at this one.”\r\n\r\nZack scrunches up his face.\r\n\r\n“Do you see it shimmer? Like the sun is really hot?”\r\n\r\nZack nods.\r\n\r\nWhen my art school instructor thought we’d reached this new state of seeing, he’d pull out his weathered copy of Don Quixote and read to us. A while back, I told Zack about Don Quixote. I told him about the quest, the windmills he saw as giants, Sancho Panza, just broad strokes, to give him an idea. I’m never sure what Zack thinks about the things I tell him. Susan’s probably right, I treat him like he’s older than he is. But he’s a great listener and there are days I really need that.\r\n\r\nI get us a couple of cokes out of the machine and we go and sit outside.\r\n\r\n“What’d you like best?” I asked him.\r\n\r\n“The paintings in that one room. The blurry ones.”\r\n\r\nZack and I finish our cokes and toss the cans in the recycle bin next to the gallery exit.\r\n\r\n“You hungry? I know a great bakery close by,” I say.\r\n\r\nA few blocks later, strong smells, made more pungent by the June heat, waft over to us. As we turn onto the first block of Chinatown, I watch Zack’s eyes go wide. It’s an exploded canvas of colour and sound. Chinese characters are slashed across the scarlet canopies that hang over vibrant fruit stands. Light bounces off a box of shiny mandarins and makes the oranges look like tiny planets, each with their own sunrise. Zack stops and stares at a crate full of strangely shaped golden fruit.\r\n\r\n“Those are star fruit,” I say.\r\n\r\n“They look like lips glued together.”\r\n\r\n“You’re right, they do. But if you slice them, they come out in star shapes.”\r\n\r\nZack picked one up and the vendor spoke to him in Chinese. Zack looked up and nodded. He set the fruit back down and we kept walking.\r\n\r\n“Could you understand that?” I ask.\r\n\r\n“Not all of it. He sounds like my dad. He said the fruit made a good drink, but it could give you hiccups.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think that’s true?”\r\n\r\n“Maybe. I’ll ask my grandma.”\r\n\r\nWe pass another fruit stand and Zack stops again. “I’ve seen some of these in her house.” He points at a table overflowing with durian. The spiked fruit teeters on a thin board that sits atop a crate. Durian reeks like no other fruit I know.\r\n\r\n“It looks like an armadillo. It smells like an armadillo,” I say.\r\n\r\nZack laughs. Then he says, “They look dangerous, like they could hurt you.”\r\n\r\nI pick one up; it’s heavier than I think. I hand it to Zack.\r\n\r\n“A yojimbo could use it. To protect someone,” he says.\r\n\r\n“You’re right.” Zack’s memory always amazes me.\r\n\r\nA pair of side-by-side electronics shops blast frenzied Chinese melodies. The two singer’s voices shoot up and down the scale, and twist into one cacophonous song. Zack and I walk a little quicker to get past the noise. We bump into a few people as we hurry.\r\n\r\nZack tells me his dad has brought him down here a couple of times.\r\n\r\n“He doesn’t like it.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?” I ask.\r\n\r\n“Too many people.”\r\n\r\nThe street is even more crowded than when we first entered. In front of the bakery, an older Asian lady lugging two huge canvas bags stops and nods to Zack. The warm sugary smell is a welcome replacement from the stench of crab and oily trout that hit us when we went by the fish market. I buy us a couple of steamed pork buns and a large coconut tart. The bakery had been a regular stop for Carol and me. I haven’t been here in months. Zack plunges into the pork bun. I hand him a napkin to wipe the red off his chin. He smiles and says through a full mouth, “Good.”\r\n\r\nWe finish the buns and the tart and share a drink so sweet that even Zack screws up his face after he sips. We go into the shop next door and I buy a bottle of water. We each take huge gulps, trying to wash away the sugar.\r\n\r\nZack peers into each shop we pass. He studies the different fruit of each stand, remarking on the shapes and colours. Bananas look different when they’re next to a box of dragon fruit; it’s like the exotic makes even the common seem unfamiliar. A few of the vendors wave at Zack, they say something in Chinese, Zack nods and smiles. I feel envious not understanding this other language. It’s more than the language—Zack sees every colour, smell, and face as a new and wondrous thing. The world opens up and offers its beauty to him; Zack takes it in with deep breaths and wide-open eyes.\r\n\r\nCarol and I used to spend Saturday mornings at the Art Gallery and then head over to Chinatown for hot and sour. I marveled at the slight, and sometimes vast, differences in the soups. Some jiggled when we spooned into them; some of the broths were dark and murky; others had a pinkish hue. Sometimes the spiciness was barely noticeable; other times our lips went numb and we waved at the waiter for another jug of ice water. Then we’d go over to the bakery and get a few pork buns for the subway ride home. Every time we went it was different. I wanted to be able to see things that way again, like Carol did, like Zack does.\r\n\r\nZack walks up the stairs to a shop that has tables full of little blinking toys. I decide to stay at the bottom and wait for him. I wave to let him know it’s okay. Next door, in a restaurant window, hangs a row of barbequed ducks. It’s a common sight in Chinatown, but these headless birds look different. It takes me a moment to realize it’s because they’re not glistening. Usually, the ducks are covered in a shiny glaze, for taste and I guess visual appeal. These ducks are unglazed—maybe, it’s some different technique. The skin is dull brown, and looks like leather. It reminds me of the shriveled bodies that spring out of coffins in old Vincent Price movies. I turn to tell Zack to come down and look at the scary ducks. I can’t see him, so I go upstairs to the shop. He’s not by any of the tables. It’s odd he didn’t yell down to me. I’m already chastising myself for letting him go by himself.\r\n\r\nInside, a shopkeeper sits behind a glass counter full of more blinking toys. He has on black suspenders, a set of round glasses perch on his bald head. I bend down and look up one of the aisles and then another, thinking maybe Zack was crouched down studying a lower shelf. The shopkeeper must have picked up on my increasingly frantic movements.\r\n\r\n“You lose something?” he asks.\r\n\r\n“No, I don’ t think so.” I go quickly over to the last aisle and bend down again. “Is this all of your shop?”\r\n\r\nHe shakes his head.\r\n\r\n“I mean, is there another door, at the back or—”\r\n\r\n“What you lose?”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t—” I take in a deep breath. “Did you see a little boy come in here?”\r\n\r\n“No. I see no boy.”\r\n\r\nI race outside. How did I miss him? I bolt down the stairs and run into a woman coming out of the restaurant. She yells at me in Chinese.\r\n\r\n“Sorry. Did you see a little boy anywhere here?” I put my hand out at Zack’s approximate height. “Like this? He had black hair and a red shirt, or wait, orange, damn, I can’t remember the colour!” I can see she doesn’t understand what I’m saying. I turn and yell, “Zack!” and then turn again, “Zack!”\r\n\r\nI head back toward the electronic shops. The street is clogged with bodies and I have to bump and jostle through the crowd. People are yelling at me in Chinese and I catch pieces of English curses. I say, “excuse me” a couple of times, but then give up and just yell Zack’s name over the crowd noise. There’s a wall of people in front of the fish market. I dart into the street and stride quickly, but have to leap to get out of the way of an oncoming streetcar.\r\n\r\nI spy a small head bobbing next to a woman. The kid’s got black hair and he’s holding the woman’s hand. I almost knock over two older men trying to get to him.\r\n\r\n“Zack?” I’m right behind the boy and touch his shoulder. He turns his head and I look into his dark Asian eyes. The mother stops walking and turns around. She gives me a quizzical look, the boy moves to her side.\r\n\r\n“What do you want?” she says with barely a hint of accent. She is smartly dressed and quite beautiful.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you.” I’m out of breath. The mother takes a step back, her son moves closer. “I’m looking for a little boy, I thought your son was—”\r\n\r\n“You have a Chinese son?” she asks. People are moving quickly around us.\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t, he’s my nephew, but his mom, I mean his father…” I trail off. The crowd moves around us like a fast current. I feel like a stone—immobilized by this woman and her son. “I’m sorry.”\r\n\r\nAnd then I run back into the street and cross again. I see another electronics store and rush up the stairs. It looks like the one we had passed, but I can’t be sure. There is a table full of blinking toys, similar to the store where I last saw Zack. But I left that store, didn’t I? My pulse pounds in my head and I’m having a hard time concentrating. I take some deep breaths, try to focus. For some odd reason, I’m reminded of my instructor, his calm voice reading from Quixote, how it relaxed me as I painted. I stop; rest my hands at my side. I can do this. He isn’t lost, he hasn’t been taken.\r\n\r\nI walk back down the stairs and stop on the sidewalk. The crowd has become one flowing mass, their voices a deep thrum. The sun dips behind a cloud and casts a grey light on the street. The harsh reds are drained of their strength. I barely feel the people as they swim by. I pace up the street, confident, looking intently at each shop. I will find him.\r\n\r\nA minute later, I push down another wave of panic that surges within me. What will I tell Susan? My God. I have to find him. I stand on the edge of the street and imagine myself far away, in another place, even another time. I’ve felt this way before. It was when I picked up the phone and heard Susan telling me about Carol’s accident. How she didn’t suffer. It was like she was calling me from a different country. She said she was gone. Where? I asked, in a whisper, barely comprehending what I was being told.\r\n\r\nI hear the squeal of a streetcar approaching. I take another step into the street. I step again and my foot knocks against a long stick. It’s bamboo. It looks misplaced lying against the asphalt. I bend over and pick it up as the streetcar brushes past.\r\n\r\nThe street is empty, which strikes me as strange, as if the streetcar wiped away all the traffic behind it. I wade into the street, holding the bamboo. I toss it high and watch it do one, then two and a half turns. It hits the street and rattles. One end of the stick rests against my foot; the other points back to where I’d last seen Zack. The street and the people come back into focus. A nearby ghetto blaster plays an Asian melody, but with a twangy guitar. I don’t know the words, but the tune is unmistakable, Wayfaring Stranger. I walk past the fish market, moving deftly through the crowd—they seem to part for me. I pass a fruit stand, then another, and then I stand in front of the hanging ducks. At the top of the stairs stands Zack. He’s holding a blinking toy. I rush up the stairs, kneel down and hug him.\r\n\r\n“Zack, what happened?” He looks surprised at the anger in my voice.\r\n\r\n“I—” He starts to cry.\r\n\r\nI hold him tight against me. “Are you okay?” I ask softly. “Did someone take you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nThe old man steps out of his shop, round glasses still perched on his head.\r\n\r\n“She has lost her son, long time,” he says.\r\n\r\n“Who are you talking about?” My voice rises. I look back at Zack.\r\n\r\n“I tried to tell you, but you didn’t hear.” Zack is sobbing, his words come out in gulps. “She walked so fast.”\r\n\r\n“She saw your boy and he was like him. She missed her son very much.”\r\n\r\nI pick up Zack and stand to face the shopkeeper. “Where is she?”\r\n\r\n“I will call police?” the old man asks.\r\n\r\n“Did she hurt him? Zack did she—” Zack shakes his head, then buries into my shoulder. The shopkeeper says more, but I’m barely listening: she was crying, ran away, disappeared, fish shop—I hear just bits of it. I know I’m standing on the edge of what could have happened. No one who loved Zack would have ever seen him again. It’s like her son—she probably remembers the last day she saw him.\r\n\r\n“No.” That’s all I say to the old man.\r\n\r\nI stroke Zack’s hair. I say, I’m sorry, I tell him he’s safe. I won’t let him go.\r\n\r\nHe lifts his head. “I was scared.”\r\n\r\n“Me too.” Zack tucks his face back into my shoulder, it feels good.\r\n\r\nAs we descend the stairs, Zack hugs me tighter. We pass the last block of Chinatown and turn onto College Street. The sun is back out, making its afternoon descent. I’m glad for the light, it feels hot against my forehead and I lean into the warmth.', 'Craig Terlson has been an illustrator, drawing for magazines and books for the past 20 years.

(19, 'Weekend with the Boy', 'I get a phone call from the past saying “It’s time your son met his father.” There’s not a whole lot I can do because she’s flown him halfway round the world for the purpose. I remember some letter a couple months back, and with me busy it getting misplaced and forgetting about it and, knowing me, surely she can’t expect anything else. From experience I’ve found that most worries disappear when you stop worrying about them.\r\n\r\nThen she calls and says, “Well, we’re here.”\r\n\r\n“Who’s where?”\r\n\r\n“We’re staying with my friend Nikki. Let me know a good time tomorrow and I’ll bring him round.”\r\n\r\nIn our short exchange Elaine asks no question, makes no request, and I wonder what once drove me to love this woman who contributes to the conversation nothing but demands. When you impose yourself out of the bluest of blues a more conciliatory approach is in order.\r\n\r\nOf course I’d like to meet the boy—if he is my flesh and blood—but I’m a private man with little enough time for myself, and on the phone I get a little agitated and Elaine gets a little heated saying I told you two months ago and this and that, as if blaming on me all miscommunications in human history. It’s a bit rich coming from her—but then I’ve always made it a point to be accommodating of the hysterics of women.\r\n\r\nSo a bony eleven-year-old with a running nose and a bowl haircut out of some forgotten century arrives on the doorstep still clinging to the hand of Elaine, who after all these years looks almost the same. The idea that I’ve fathered this boy who can’t even look at me is almost amusing, and I wonder if I should have paid all that money to Elaine a few years back without asking for a test to prove he’s mine.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry I can’t stay with the two of you,” she says, “but Nikki already got an appointment at the Homestead Clinic for the two of us, and those people aren’t very flexible, and—anyway, you’ll have a good time together.”\r\n\r\nIn Elaine’s mind she must think abandoning her boy with me for three days is good for us. Or it fits her scheme of how things can work. I’ve given up trying to follow her logic.\r\n\r\n“I’ll be back Monday to pick him up.” She pauses, and before going out adds to me in a whisper, “Be careful with him. He’s a little sensitive.”\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nIt began as a romantic story. I met Elaine in Firenze, we were travellers, a pretty young American with long brown hair, a thirty-three-year-old Australian. She was an art history student in Roma at the time. She’d come on a day trip with some classmates to see the paintings and we met in the Uffizi Gallery under a Botticelli. To a friend she was whispering something about symbolism, saying the sea was the Eternal Feminine, a celebration of woman’s cool triumph after man’s sexual exhaustion—or some nonsense you can only pick up in art history classes. I’m normally reticent with strangers but in this case I had to interrupt, pleading that a great painting must be felt, understood intuitively rather than analysed with preconceptions. For that is how paintings are created: there is no long map of formulas you can methodically steer in order to create an immortal work of art, rather the work comes out of the artist’s soul. Textbook vocabulary merely reduces a living painting back to dead formula.\r\n\r\nElaine was impressed enough by my conviction to give me her phone number.\r\n\r\nWhen two weeks later I headed south and passed through Rome, we met for coffee. She taught me that the plural of our drink was cappuccini. She showed me the coliseum. I bought a bronze lion from a souvenir stand which, giggling, we called the Beast. I dropped her off at her student flat. I followed her up for another coffee. We talked haltingly about music and leaving our countries and anything but art. There was a tension in the room I wasn’t strong enough to navigate, so, awkwardly, I left. From her fourth storey window she leaned out and shouted down at me.\r\n\r\n“You’ve forgotten the Beast!”\r\n\r\nI ran up the stairs again, two at a time, and at the top she met me, and we kissed, embraced, and in that moment it felt like we held the world together. Whatever people want to say about the nature of love, this was love. In that instant we felt something eternal.\r\n\r\nIn the morning I decided to spend another day in Rome, before I travelled onwards, to Greece, into my work. Elaine understood that I couldn’t stay. If we had lost touch it would have remained the sweetest memory of my entire travels, that day wandering the alleys of Rome, sun shining, then making love again in the high grass of a forgotten field.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nThe boy’s name is Joe. A silly name for the son of an artist. I prefer “boy”, because at least it approximates the creature. Joe, scrawny and bowl-haired, looks nothing at all like a Joe.\r\n\r\nI don’t know what to say him. He doesn’t seem happy or unhappy to be here, he follows me around as I show him my flat without a word, nose dribbling, then saying “That’s a nice painting,” as he singles out the most mediocre piece in the entire place, a gift from a student showing a rowboat leaving a tropical island and heading for deep dark ocean.\r\n\r\nI show him a diary of mine, completed over a decade ago with an entry dated from Santorini, 7 April, 1995, in which I wrote, And, my God, I still love Elaine!\r\n\r\n“You were born out of great love,” I explain to the boy in trembling sincerity, but he doesn’t seem particularly impressed, head tilting in what could be a shrug. “You were conceived in Rome,” I continue lightly. “That makes you a Roman!” I playfully jab at his shoulder, which seems to shock rather than relax him.\r\n\r\nHis indifference to my efforts makes me nervous, and when he stands there looking at his feet, I begin to resent the judgments he is making against me.\r\n\r\n“How’s school?”\r\n\r\n“Fine.”\r\n\r\n“What are you learning?”\r\n\r\n“Stuff.”\r\n\r\n“You like your teachers?”\r\n\r\n“We have one teacher. She’s okay.”\r\n\r\n“You have some good friends in your class?\r\n\r\n“Not really.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you want to see what I’m working on?”\r\n\r\n“Okay.”\r\n\r\nI show him my latest painting, which happens to be Nude Before the Act. It is a variation of one of my most recognized pieces and I’m very proud of the entire series. But he stands there, looking at it impassively, or uncomfortably. Don’t boys like to see naked women?\r\n\r\nI can’t explain to him that if I can’t paint I might as well die, that this isn’t some personal choice, like I have chosen work over fatherhood. Sons and lovers and my own needs pale in significance with the forces that have given me this human flaw and continue to drive it into me like a stake to the heart. I can’t explain it and I can’t expect him to understand.\r\n\r\nSo I tell him how I am able to make judgments on people based on their reception to my art—those unimpressed are also uncultured and brainwashed by the fucking brainless popular culture. I get a little agitated, which is the only way to be when discussing absurdity, and again the boy is unresponsive.\r\n\r\n“So what do you think?” I ask him.\r\n\r\n“Good.”\r\n\r\nWhat do you like about it? I should ask, but I doubt he would have an answer.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nOf course I see in the oppressively silent boy an alternate version of my younger self. It took me decades to overcome a stifling timidity. But the very fact I can understand his reticence means he can also understand more of me than others, that he can recognize if I exaggerate my way out of nervousness, or speak inventions in the face of not having at hand the right words.\r\n\r\nWhen I tell the boy about Sydney life I hear my own voice. I am conscious of its tinniness. My voice twangs—it doesn’t reverberate. The words are not what I want to say. I use words larger than what I normally use. I say sycophant and nonplussed and prodigiously. I also say fuck and whore. I grope more in the darkness than in the light of language. The boy’s silence accuses me of insufficiency.\r\n\r\n“So now we’re back in the kitchen.”\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\n“Hungry?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“What did you eat for breakfast?”\r\n\r\n“Toast. Banana.”\r\n\r\nHe says banana in a nasal American way which makes me cringe.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nIt was five years after my Rome visit that Elaine tracked me down, finding my latest number through an art dealer. I was happy to get her call from America until she told my why she was calling.\r\n\r\n“I named him Joe.”\r\n\r\n“Why on earth would you do that?”\r\n\r\n“We could really use some money to get by.”\r\n\r\n“You think I have any?”\r\n\r\nEvery few years we had a short conversation like this. Sometimes I sent a little money, sometimes I argued I was sending money into a void; I should at least know who the kid was. Then she’d demand plane tickets for the two of them to visit, and we were back where we started.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nThere’s nothing more to see in my flat, and talking quickly winds down again to monosyllables. I take Joe to see a film. At this point I’m not choosy and go to the only cinema in town which still shows proper films. Even for the boy’s sake I’m not willing to sit through his idea of a film, which is some Star Wars Trek nonsense. The timing is good, when we arrive a film has just started. It is Australian, independent, and was released four years ago but recently it won some award so it’s in the cinema again. It turns out to be perhaps a bit erotic for an eleven-year-old, but he slides down in his seat as if he has never seen a naked body before—nervousness hums over his skin so thickly that I can hear it. In turn it makes me nervous.\r\n\r\nDespite this, it’s a pretty good film. The director has since gone Hollywood and made some utter piece of crap, but this film moves me for part of it by having a young supporting actress with sensual eyes and pretty tits and by stirring up a bit of anger and a bit of sentiment. Then the film ends, we go for a meal, and the film’s emotion already begins to fade. The message doesn’t cling to memory. By next week I’ll have forgotten the film’s impact, will only remember a few details I can, if necessary, raise in future conversation.\r\n\r\nBut not in present conversation. The boy picks at his food.\r\n\r\nWhy is the world seduced by film? It’s no better than paint. Perhaps it’s worse. A painting lives with you. It hovers above the sofa in the living room and becomes a companion, or it hangs in a museum and, if good enough, leaves an imprint on its visitor. I must have made thirty visits to den Haag’s Mauritshuis. One dozen just to stare at Rembrandt’s Anatomy Lesson. That inverted hand still makes me shudder. Another dozen to watch Vermeer’s pearl-earring girl turn her head in perpetual surprise at my love for her.\r\n\r\nMaybe the odd young fool goes to see Titanic a dozen times—but would anyone look at a single frame more than twice? The potency of film is in its movement. Like a shark, when it stops moving it dies. But a painting moves too, and it lives forever. The movement is subtle. It registers at a more subconscious dream level that has more power. A painting is like a monastic ascetic who will say only a few sentences a year but each of them are relevant and can potentially change your life. But a movie is like an American, bellowing out to the world the latest cliché which he thinks makes him look smart but in fact broadcasts his incapacity for original thought.\r\n\r\nFilm is too easy, too obvious. A scene of a girl walking to school can be enchanting simply because it dances. But a painting of a girl walking to school has a life’s story in each brushstroke, in every choice of colour, in every detail—book bag, pigtail, fleshy pink knee—stroked tenderly into the canvas.\r\n\r\n“What did you think of the film?” I ask the boy.\r\n\r\n“Good,” he answers. Then his silence shuts him up again. Is that his only thought on anything? Is good the only word of criticism he can utter?\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nSome aspect of the film, though, triggers a thought. I don’t know what part of the film or what thought. The thought is like a pointed shovel scraping at a sediment of sentiment imbedded in the brain. A clump is dislodged, uneven, small, but large enough to work with. When we get home I need to transfer this to canvas. No, not canvas, to something porous, to a block of wood. I grab a flat piece of cedar from the shed and get to work.\r\n\r\nGood painting is connected to dream. The more nights I have in which to dream, the better my paintings become. That might explain why I was a late bloomer. It took me three and a half decades of living and dreaming until I completed the first painting I was proud of.\r\n\r\nA shovel and sediment is a crass way of putting it. More eloquently, it is a purity, a timeless stream which brings me my inspiration. Something beyond that which is here—an absolute which dream imperfectly connects us to. Once in a while it weaves itself underneath and I get my feet wet. Once a year or so it is deep enough to bathe in. And once or twice in a lifetime it is a torrent, a waterfall so powerful it seems easier to drown in its currents than survive.\r\n\r\nMuch of the time I simply wait for this stream to reach me, or I trek through the mountains of my mind searching for it. During these periods it might look like I am doing nothing, to an observer like I’m gazing out the window, sipping whisky or surfing Internet porn, but in fact I am waiting for the water of insight to reach me.\r\n\r\nOthers speak of muses, bringers of inspiration, but this is too anthropomorphic. There is no person proffering apples of dreams, rather a stream of timelessness out of which every great work of art—and perhaps every exceptional work of science—springs.\r\n\r\nEven my son is secondary to this force.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nAs I work I think I hear singing in the other room. When I need a break, I investigate. Sure enough, he is looking out the window humming something I don’t recognize. It isn’t a sad song, rather it is a little childish, but the way he is singing it hits some sad note that reverberates in me. The loneliness a human being feels in the face of an onslaught of absence. I go back to the painting but now it is all wrong. It isn’t sad enough, which means it isn’t true. It takes me most of the night to texture even the beginnings of truth into it.\r\n\r\nBy profession and by character I’m an artist. There are things I do well and things I do very badly. I’m poor at names. I can’t remember what days the rubbish goes out. I haven’t remembered a birthday in twenty years—including, unless I’m reminded, my own. I think I’m a good observer of people and nature. I like to think I see the true colours in things, or rather can almost feel their textures on my skin, along the contours of the brain. (No, that’s not right—I can only explain my thoughts using clichés, since verbalizing what I feel is not my forte either.) I’m hopeless in my personal relationships. Women come and go, as if my will was irrelevant in the matter. They insinuate themselves into my life, and then they go amidst a great show of tears and anguish. And then there is always another girl. It has always been this way, and even as I age it continues as before. Sometimes all these faults cause me great pain—a huge wall of insufficiency towers up and breaks over me and I suffocate in that darkness. And then I work. I work myself out of mind and time. This doesn’t mean my work brings me contentment—it would be a great lie to claim happiness. I work because no other life exists. Painting at its most vivid is a lifeblood-absorbing experience, like a wound, open, raw, festering. Art takes out of me the strength for most daily tasks, which no doubt includes parenting. If the boy comes to hate me for who I am, then he hasn’t considered how much I suffer.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nThe boy, like me, doesn’t seem to like the mornings. He comes to my work room looking irritated and sleepy. I never seem to sleep much any more and have been up for a couple hours already.\r\n\r\n“Want some bread?”\r\n\r\nThe boy shrugs. In the kitchen I take two slices out of the package and lay them on a plate. I rummage in the refrigerator for some cheese. I find some margarine and an old bottle of jam with a few flecks of mould in it. I set them on the table with a knife. The boy smears a little margarine on one slice, puts the two slices together, rolls them and starts nibbling at the edge. His eyes move around uncomfortably.\r\n\r\nI’m a good observer of people, but have no experience with boys. Except, that is, the children of my lovers. At my age a few of the women I attract now have children they try not to mention too often. These little boys and girls of theirs are abstractions to me, like the near mythical East European or East Asian villages their mothers were born in, or like one’s allergy to eggs, or another’s phobia of heights. One woman has a Ph.D in tidal pool anemones; another has a five-year-old boy at home with a babysitter for the evening. These abstractions, besides the details I paint, are all I know of children.\r\n\r\nHe seems uncomfortable that I’m watching him eat, so I go back to finish my painting. There are a few more strokes to make, a few adjustments, and then I can leave it for a while.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nWe take a long drive in the country.\r\n\r\nI have to take the boy somewhere—he’s moped around my flat long enough, casting a silent web of nervousness through it—and I also have to pick up a painting in a cottage I bought in the country, near Lithgow, so it’s a case of two birds and a stone. On the way, I talk about my life a bit, to give him a sense of what adults are faced with in our lives. My struggles to fend off the bank, and having to sell some of my paintings cheaply just to have money to buy Christmas presents (two or three years ago I sent him a watch with van Gogh’s Bridge at Arles on its face that cost over fifty dollars—he probably doesn’t even remember), my fights with one of my tenants—all to give him an idea of the financial worries I deal with every day of my life. He seems unimpressed even by the beautiful stretch of forest we’re driving through. If I point out a particularly vibrant texture on a section of canopy or a dazzle of green where the sun catches a eucalyptus at the perfect angle, I can see the boy staring off in the right direction but have to wonder how much he really sees. He never complains once along the two-hour drive, though. The girls and models I take here invariably grumble about the distance or need for a toilet stop or pang of sudden hunger. But the boy is a quiet one.\r\n\r\nWhen I ask, the boy mentions a few men in Elaine’s life the past few years, and I wonder how they would have interacted with him. Look, kid, you’re just one of my obstacles to boning your mother! They would have tried to play footy with him (or whatever sports Americans play), or teach him fishing in the hope it would impress his mother enough to open her legs for them. And they wouldn’t have known how to talk to him. Hey kid … So you’re eleven? You into girls yet? They would have struggled to get more than a sentence from the boy at a time.\r\n\r\nI ask him what kind of house he and his mother have in Seattle and he mutters, without eye-contact, something about government housing, which must be some nonsense his mother is feeding him. As if America has government housing like some Scandinavian welfare state! The poor kid is forced to absorb whatever reality his mother insinuates herself into.\r\n\r\nWe reach the run-down little cottage I bought as an occasional rural escape and the boy runs through its corridors as if it is a grand old palace.\r\n\r\n“This place is huge!” he shouts. “I could get lost!”\r\n\r\nMaybe children, being smaller, have a different take on spatial dimensions.\r\n\r\nIn the room I designated as my painting den, my most recent nude is drying in the corner. The boy takes one glance and averts his eyes—as if the sight of a human figure can consign his soul to hell. It is the third time he reacts like this, and it makes me suspicious. Is the kid religious? Is his mother feeding him some nonsense new-age cult? Or just the normal old-age nonsense?\r\n\r\nOutside it is getting to be late afternoon. In the new light I start noticing an inconsistency with perspective in the painting and feel a duty to change it. People think that artists make art but actually it’s the other way around: an artistic sensibility is a conduit for experiences which must be transcribed into a more permanent form. The poor artist is helpless in the face of the forces which drive him.\r\n\r\nThe boy is off in the back or in one of the rooms—I can’t well check the entire property, so I get down to work. By the time I find the perfect burnt shade of umber, though, natural light has all but faded, and artificial light is too fickle to be trusted. The timing of it irritates me; the conditions necessary for the accomplishment of art are as temporary as the right mood needed to paint. Both have to be synchronous, and I blame the boy a little for skewing them; if he hadn’t been thrust upon my doorstep I would have finished the painting by now.\r\n\r\nIt would be unfair to blame the boy to his face and I don’t have to. Maybe he saw me at work and has the consideration not to bother me, running off somewhere to play Star Wars Trek or do whatever boys do on their own. I pull up a chair far across from the painting, light my pipe and pour myself a Scotch.\r\n\r\nI have an inspiration completely unrelated to the nude. It’s a tiny spark of an idea, and suddenly I begin a fresh canvas, squeezing paints onto the palette and then, when that becomes too slow, straight onto the canvas. I grab one tube after another and squeeze out globules of pure red or orange, working them in with the help of a brush. In a flurry of energy I take the pallet knife and smear the background until it is a moving, flowing force of lust which surrounds the intangible girl in the middle and describes perfectly what she feels.\r\n\r\n“Are we going back soon?” asks a little voice from somewhere, and the answer is so obviously no that I don’t bother to answer.\r\n\r\nA while later it comes again: “I’m bored.”\r\n\r\n“Only boring people get bored!” I snap, as I am in the midst of creating probably the most vivid backdrop in my entire history of abstract portraits.\r\n\r\nIt isn’t until dawn that I find the boy curled up in the corner of a room on the bare floorboards.\r\n\r\n“Why didn’t you hop into one of the beds?” I ask him, but he shrugs. Strange little kid!\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn the way back I am almost falling asleep at the wheel, but I feel a little proud that I could finish an entire painting despite the distractions.\r\n\r\n“What did you do last night?” I ask. To minimize diversions the house has no television or much else that could pass for entertainment. I am always either there alone painting or, more often, have a lover or model along for a weekend escape.\r\n\r\n“Played cards.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, you found the games drawer. Why didn’t you read the Trivial Pursuit questions or something?”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t wanna make a mess.”\r\n\r\n“You could have cleaned up—or left it a mess. The girls when they come always seem to do some tidying up.”\r\n\r\nHe has no response, but a few minutes later asks suddenly, “Why is there so much nudity in your paintings?”\r\n\r\nI laugh at the absurdity of the question, then I get irritated, then heated. It is his American upbringing, I tell him, that makes him think the human body is something fucking dirty.\r\n\r\nHe looks as uncomfortable as I’ve ever seen a person look. His gaze is into the sky, at the tops of the trees.\r\n\r\n“What kind of paintings do you like?” I ask, to bring him back to me.\r\n\r\n“Landscapes,” he says quietly.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nI worry the boy is never going to understand. I wonder if it’s worth trying to explain things. My own childhood was long ago, I’ve forgotten the fears and dreams of little boys—but then, he’s not so little now, he seems to know more than he lets on, likes to observe and take things in. He already grasps something I never understood even at his age—that he still has a lot more to learn. So I can relate to him as an adult, I think. He might find me strange, a bully even, but he’ll understand we’re both human, both evolved out of the same human process, linked together by blood.\r\n\r\nWhen we return to my Sydney flat, I think of Frankenstein’s creature. Born out of a scientific urge, this being was so overcome by the fact he was unwanted that he turned against everything his creator held dear. Could a child be the same? Could he grow to despise me, vowing vengeance, taking not my life—which holds little meaning to me—but what I hold more precious, mainly the beauty in nature, and my capacity for art? Would he learn the means to destroy it all until I suffer as he does?\r\n\r\nI see him as my judge, the man most likely to one day become my executioner. The prophecy of Oedipus lives on as a fear in the mind of every father Laius. The son will kill you by becoming a greater man, by inheriting all the responsibilities that you in your aged infirmity can no longer manage. The son will claim all his mother’s love and affection, leaving you with only the scraps of duty. The son will shovel the dirt upon your coffin and inherit the earth.\r\n\r\nI look on the boy. Just like I have little control over an artwork in progress, this boy has become who he is without any input from me. And yet he is perhaps my masterpiece, and I can sign my name to him.\r\n\r\n“You should go take a shower,” I say.\r\n\r\nFrom his bag he pulls out a change of clothes and a watch. He holds it up. “This is my favourite thing,” he says, “so I don’t wear it, to keep it new.”\r\n\r\nIt is the van Gogh watch I gave him years ago, when he still had never met me.\r\n\r\nI lean down and wipe his nose with a tissue.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nHe sings in his room. I enjoy another Scotch. He comes into the kitchen looking cleaned up. I relax a little; Elaine when she comes in the morning won’t be angry that I’ve neglected him.\r\n\r\nI ask him what song he keeps humming when he is by himself.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. I think I made it up.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t figure out why, but it’s very sad.”\r\n\r\n“Aren’t all good songs that way?”\r\n\r\nI smile and shake my head. To disprove him I play some of my music. Greek bouzouki, Spanish flamenco, light gypsy ballads, blues rock. “The melodies make you feel like dancing.” He doesn’t seem convinced, so I play some uplifting Mozart piano concertos. “He almost never wrote a concerto in minor key, which are gloomier.”\r\n\r\n“He just tried to hide the sadness better,” says the boy. “But it’s there.”\r\n\r\nI listen and finish my Scotch. When I really listen, I realize he’s right. It all suddenly seems so sad that a tear almost forms. Then it does form and trickles down and another comes and I kneel down and suddenly can’t stop from weeping. I’m weeping like a child. Why do I weep? I weep because I suffer, and because the boy suffers, and since I suffer it is impossible to stop the suffering of the boy. I weep because I hated my father until the day he died, when I realized I loved him all along. And I weep for my insufficiencies, and I weep for my past crimes of weakness, and I weep because of this quiet little boy who I don’t even know but already love.\r\n\r\nThen this show of weakness shames me. I find myself holding a boy who doesn’t want to be held, his body stiff, arms hanging awkwardly at his sides. But I feel a little unburdened, and I smile at the absurdity of our pose. And I laugh. And then the boy laughs too, and we laugh uproariously like two madmen.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nLater it occurs to me that in recent years I have felt a full spectrum of emotions—I’ve wept, raged, roared in triumph, and cowered in loneliness. But it has been so long, many many years, since I lost myself to laughter, to a neck-arching, gaping-mouthed uninhibited laughter like that.\r\n\r\nIs the timeless stream of purity wound in a coil around the boy’s solitude? When I hold him and when I laugh with him and when I paint passionately, the force I feel in my bones is the same.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nWhen Elaine comes in the morning to take Joe back she asks, “And how did it go?”\r\n\r\n“It went just fine.”\r\n\r\n“I can take him off your hands now.”\r\n\r\nI say, “Well, there’s really no hurry.”', 'Ezra was born in West Berlin but has lived just about everywhere.

(20, 'This One Thing', 'Carlton is huge. Even for a Great Pyrenees, known for their size and snowy fur like a fresh avalanche, he is colossal. Serious heft. Ample beef scraps from the table and a lackluster exercise regimen has ballooned Carlton to nearly 200 pounds. Not only is he the biggest non-livestock animal I have ever seen in my life, he slobbers like a baby with a jaw full of candy. Susan and I keep three mops in the house to swab his drool.\r\n\r\nDon’t even get me started on his droppings. Suffice it to say, a dog the size of a horse can produce some mammoth turds. If our house didn’t sit on an acre and a half of ground, I’d seriously consider taking him for the long ride in the country. Even with a lawn as big as ours, walking through it is still like negotiating a minefield.\r\n\r\nOne summer evening the year after we got the dog, Susan and I tried playing croquet in the backyard. We were on some kind of kick to get more active. After the first errant ball slopped through one of Carlton’s lawn bombs, we boxed up the set and pitched it in the trash. No biggie. Who wants to play croquet? We’ve resigned ourselves to sipping lemonade on the patio and watching it pile up. The bright side is that our grass is as green as a golf course, though I wouldn’t recommend putting around. And that’s the crazy thing: the stuff that kills the neighbors’ grass is the very stuff that’s making ours worthy of a turf-builder ad. We’ve got our problems, sure, but the lawn is fine.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nIt was Susan’s idea. After studying for the bar twice, I had finally passed and recently hired on with Johannsen, Smith, and Johannsen, a one-stop shop in town. I was in the home office, straightening papers on my desk and Susan walked in the room and said, “Mark, I think it’s time.”\r\n\r\nIf there’s one thing I know, it’s Susan. So I knew what she meant, and even though I wasn’t sure I was ready, we talked about it and agreed that everything fit. Our college days were looking pretty small in the rearview. We were settled in a new house with a huge lawn and the money was finally stable. Susan didn’t even have to work, but spent most of her days sculpting clay angels that she would or would not sell to the local boutiques. She stopped taking the pill the next day. Who decides the time is right based on how the lawn looks? I don’t know; it just felt right.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nSusan was as giddy as I’d ever seen her. I mean she glowed. I tried to tell her to wait until we knew the gender at least, but she said we could buy unisex. We drove downtown in the rain and strolled the baby aisles of every department store we could find, buying twenty or so tiny outfits in gender-neutral reds and greens. We also got the crib, the stroller, and an old-fashioned rocking bassinet made from hand-tooled maple strips. It cost $375 and I was jealous. The baby wasn’t even here yet and it already had the nicest furniture in the house. Maybe we did get a little carried away, but we were having fun.\r\n\r\nThere’s something to be said about decorating your own child’s nursery. I’ve found that fathers-to-be have to be involved in these little projects. Susan felt the motherly bond building as soon as she peed on the strip and it showed positive. But for me, I noticed that I had to do something hands-on. The shopping was nice. But when I was covered in both pink and blue splotches of paint—we were covering our bases, just in case—I was Daddy.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nI think Susan is brainwashing Carlton. I’m the one who feeds and waters him. I’m the one who hauls out the huge steel tub and bathes him every Saturday. And I’m also the one who carts the wheelbarrow out back, shoveling badger-sized mounds of Carlton’s goodies each fall. And what do I get for my efforts? The other night Susan and I were wrestling around in the living room when all of a sudden I felt inch-and-a-half canines latch onto my ass. I tried to tell him we were just playing, but the crazy mutt wouldn’t let go. It felt like I was going to lose a cheek. Hell of a guard dog. If he ever pulls a stunt like that again, I’m having him put down. Susan still laughs about it. But she’s the one who had to apply the ointment.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nI was in the middle of a patent suit when I came home one day to find Susan crying at the kitchen sink. Her head was down and as I walked up beside her I could see her shoulders shaking. At first I thought she was laughing, but she heard me coming and when she turned around, I saw the wetness on her cheeks.\r\n\r\n“What happened?” I asked her.\r\n\r\nShe didn’t say anything. She reached out to me and took my hands in her hands. Then she lifted her shirt a little and put my hands on her stomach. Her skin was warm.\r\n\r\nSusan was looking at me. She said, “Can you feel that?” My hands were there. I couldn’t feel anything. I held my breath and felt her belly and didn’t say anything. “Mark, can’t you feel that?”\r\n\r\n“No honey, I can’t. But it’s still soon, right?” I tried to sound reassuring.\r\n\r\nThen Susan smiled. “I can feel it, Mark. Not right now, but today I did. First at lunch and I thought I was imagining it. But then a few minutes ago I was going to wash some dishes and I felt it again. I can actually feel the baby. Can you believe it? There’s a baby in me.” She almost laughed. From her big open smile, I could tell she almost laughed.\r\n\r\nI was surprised at how strongly it came over me. I’m sure it was relief that nothing was wrong, but I got excited. “Are you sure? Can you really feel it?” I tried to feel it again. I pushed a little with my fingers. “What does it feel like?” I kept prying with my fingers. I was really getting going. Her skin was warm and smooth and I kept feeling her there.\r\n\r\nSusan was still holding my hands on her stomach. “I’m sure. Not at first, but now I am. Oh, I wish you could feel it.” Susan doesn’t sing, but the way she looked then, I suddenly wished she would. I remember seeing her there in the kitchen and wishing she would sing.\r\n\r\nI wished I could, too, that is, feel the baby. But I was thrilled anyway. I got a little corny. I knelt down and started kissing Susan’s stomach everywhere. I said, “I love you, baby. Can you hear me, baby? It’s your Daddy and I love you.” And I kissed her some more. I kept saying “baby.” Susan laughed and said she liked it when I said that. She said she liked it when I said “baby.” And then I asked again, “What does it feel like?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” she said. “It’s hard to say.” She closed her eyes kind of squinty. She does that when she’s concentrating. And sometimes her nose crinkles. “It feels like something. Something little.” She was quiet for a while and she held my head against her stomach. My ear pressed against her warm skin. With one ear I could hear the plink of water dripping in the sink and with the other ear I couldn’t hear anything. Then Susan said, “It feels like a baby.”\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nEvery father has waited for the call. It’s notorious for not coming when it’s convenient. It’s also notorious for coming sooner than expected. I was at work, of course, when it came for me. I had about twenty hours of work to do and six hours left to do it. But there are some calls that need to be taken. I took that one. It was Susan on the telephone and when I answered, she told me. We didn’t talk long. I said the only thing I could think to say. I said, “You didn’t do anything wrong.”\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nI hadn’t owned a dog since before college, but after Susan lost the baby we both needed something, some living thing into which we could pour our love, our loss. We lay in bed a couple of nights after I watched the doctor drop the 17 week-old fetus in a white bucket, and we agreed to get a dog.\r\n\r\nSusan scanned the classifieds for the next week or so. It was a subconscious thing really. I mean, we didn’t intentionally set out to get the largest animal we could find. I guess Susan figured we need something big to handle our hurt. She found a breeder in Cody, the wife of a man who owned a llama farm, and arranged for us to drive down one weekend to pick out a puppy.\r\n\r\nThe drive was 600 miles round trip and we made it in near silence. We found the place—it looked like a postcard, white picket fence and all—just south of town, ringed by a neat stand of aspens and junipers. The overwhelming quaintness of the place bothered me at first. I mean I was actually upset. But then I started thinking about it and I cooled off. The corral was out back and we could see the tousled heads of llamas bobbing up and down as we pulled off the highway, crunching gravel under our tires. And that’s when I was really through with my anger—when we saw the llamas. I guess I hadn’t ever seen any live ones before, but good night, they’re weird animals. I defy anyone to look at a llama and stay angry.\r\n\r\nThe dogs had heard us drive up and seven milk-white pups scampered toward us as soon as we got out of the car. Their wet black noses and dark eyes looked like shots of coal sunk in a bed of snow. They were, in other words, beautiful things. We leaned against the car and they danced around our ankles, yipping excitedly. There was an energy there in the country, and for a few minutes we just soaked it in. What was it? Maybe those dogs, so small and good and full of life. It really could have been those dogs. Or us. Maybe it was something we were looking for. A thing manufactured from the wordless part of us, made out of a need frenzied and deep, surfacing without our knowing it was coming. Whatever it was, it felt like rest. A relaxing of the bones. There is a peace that comes sometimes. Sometimes it comes.\r\n\r\nI squatted down to pet the dogs. They nibbled at my hands. Susan tapped me on the shoulder and pointed to the house. On the concrete porch a puppy sat alone on its haunches, completely still. It just sat there, staring at us. Susan spoke for the first time since we had crossed into Wyoming. “I want that one, Mark. Will you bring him to me, please?”\r\n\r\nA person’s life is a complicated thing. In marriage it all becomes a jumbled mess. Personalities, traditions, habits, and schedules bunch together and you spend the rest of your life trying to make sense of it. It is not a small feat. Somewhere in that sifting morass between Susan and me, it turns out there was a little space. The day we met Carlton on the llama farm in Wyoming, he walked right in and made himself at home.\r\n\r\nWe cruised back the way we had come with Susan holding the puppy in her lap. Just before we got to the house, Susan turned to me in the car and said, “What the hell kind of animals are llamas, anyway?” She has a point.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nIt’s an interesting feeling: missing something you never even had. Though I can’t say for sure, I imagine it’s a little like losing a part of your body, a hand maybe. Years afterward, you can still feel your fingertips tingle.\r\n\r\nIf it was a boy, we were going to name him Caleb. If a girl, Sara. Would he have looked like me or Susan? Would she like music, and if so, what kind? These are the questions that get asked.\r\n\r\nWe still have the clothes. They’re in a box in the nursery. The green onesies are in one pile, the red are in another. Looking at the clothes, it’s difficult to imagine a person fitting in them. They seem even smaller than when we bought them. The other things are there, too.\r\n\r\nThe room still smells like paint. Once in a while, if I come home early from work, I’ll find Susan sitting in the room, rocking the bassinet back and forth, back and forth. I can’t remember how many times I have found her there. I don’t say anything. I just walk back down the hallway as quietly as I can.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nIn our backyard, there is a gigantic old willow tree. Its branches are so long that even when the weather is calm, the tips of the branches rise and dip in a sleepy rhythm. They kiss the ground and draw back up a little, and kiss the ground again. The branches are so long and thin they remind me of taffy, warm and stretched. They make a perfect ring around the tree about twenty feet out from the trunk, so that once you are inside, they form a protective canopy all around you. It’s like being indoors. Carlton and I like to walk through the taffy branches over and over again, slowly working our way around. It feels like stepping through a curtain of beads.\r\n\r\nYears ago there was a terrible ice storm that came through the area, caking everything in a half inch layer of ice. The ice downed trees, telephone poles, and it smothered the life out of many smaller plants. The weight of the ice wrenched the willow tree so violently that it split down the center of the trunk. Luckily, the ice melted pretty fast, and the tree survived. It is healing now, but there is still a six-foot scar, gnarled and tough. The scar will be there until the tree dies. It is the largest and oldest tree on our lawn. Carlton urinates on it twice a day.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nSomething is wrong with the dog. He has been slowing down for the last year or so. We noticed that he rarely got up and walked around much. The only thing that would get him moving was food, and for a few weeks there, he just about stopped eating.\r\n\r\nWe hadn’t seen Dr. Jenkins since Carlton got his shots as a puppy, but he remembered us because Carlton was the only Great Pyrenees he’d ever had in his office. Even so, the surprise on his face was evident when we brought Carlton in. I can’t remember for sure, but I think he said, “Good Lord.” Like I said, he’s a big dog.\r\n\r\nDr. Jenkins looked in Carlton’s mouth and felt his teeth and gums. He rubbed the dog’s limbs and palpated his belly. When he listened with a stethoscope to Carlton’s heart he said, “That’s it right there. There’s the problem.” He told us that one of the valves in Carlton’s heart was leaking. Instead of hearing the normal thump, there was a whish.\r\n\r\nWe should have been watching Carlton’s weight a little better. The leaky valve would have sapped some of his energy no matter how good his diet, but since he had gotten so big, the heart had to work harder to pump his blood throughout his body. The problem was that, as Carlton’s heart pumped more forcefully, the valve got leakier and leakier. Dr. Jenkins informed us that surgery would be necessary to repair the valve. “And you’re going to have to find a way to slim that dog down some,” he said.\r\n\r\nCarlton was lying on a metal examination table. As Dr. Jenkins talked to us, he stood next to Carlton with his hand on Carlton’s head. We scheduled the surgery for the following week.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nHere’s the deal with anesthesia: there’s always a risk that once you go under, you aren’t coming back out. As your body systems slow down, there’s a very fine line to walk, which, if crossed, your life just sort of slips away before you know it. That’s why we pay anesthesiologists so much money—to keep us out of pain, but still on the right side of the line. Same deal with dogs.\r\n\r\nAfter successfully repairing the valve in Carlton’s heart, Dr. Jenkins saw that the dog wasn’t doing so well. The anesthesia should have worn off, but Carlton wasn’t coming to. I have to give Dr. Jenkins credit. He was pretty up front about it. “You better get down here. Carlton is dying.”\r\n\r\nWe noticed strange smells before we even opened the door to the room where Carlton lay. There were the odors of antiseptics and medicines. There was the acrid smell of dried blood, and the distinct smell of a body that had been opened.\r\n\r\nCarlton looked dead. He lay on his side on the table, completely motionless. His tongue lolled out the side of his mouth. It was dry. A rim of moisture glazed his eyes. They were still. Only when I put my hand carefully on his ribs could I feel the faint rise and fall that told me he was breathing.\r\n\r\nSusan was at the door. She was looking around the room, but not at Carlton. “Susan,” I said softly. “Honey, come here.” She had her arms folded across her body. She stayed where she was. She stood there in the room and hugged her arms close to herself. It was very cold in the room and Susan looked cold, too.\r\n\r\n“It’ll be okay, Susan. Come here, please.”\r\n\r\nSusan walked over by my side and she looked at Carlton. She put her hands on the sides of his face, under his ears. She stayed there for a few seconds, looking at our dog. Leaning forward, she pressed her forehead gently against his. I could barely hear her whispering, “Please, Carlton. Don’t you do it. Please baby. Please.” She sounded as if she were praying.\r\n\r\nWho could say no to that? Not me. Not the dog, either. It took awhile, but Carlton woke up.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nThis diet is killing me. Literally. I am wasting away. Susan said if Carlton has to do it, we all do. It’s been three months since the operation. Carlton has found the energy that he should have had in his youth. He deserves it; he’s lost fifty-three pounds. In human pounds, that’s like, well, it’s a lot. A couple of shih tzus at least. I’ve lost five pounds. I’m practically a skeleton, avoiding strong winds and so forth. Susan won’t tell me how much she’s lost, which is pretty much like saying she hasn’t lost any. This can’t go on much longer. I’m starving.\r\n\r\nOn the up-side, the first Johannsen retired last month. Before leaving, he asked me if I would take his place as full-partner. I pretended like I was considering it for a few seconds and then said yes.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nRight now, it is the middle of summer and Susan, Carlton, and I are sitting underneath the protective branches of the willow tree. The sun is heavy and is about to be swallowed by a blazing horizon. The night-fire is filtering through the branches and painting us in stabs and streaks of orange and red. The air in here is as calm as our lives feel. In short, things are good. Carlton’s reduced belly still makes a decent pillow.\r\n\r\nIt may be the recent promotion at work, or it may be Carlton’s full recovery, but I can feel it working in us before Susan says anything. I know what she is getting at when, under the darkening stillness beneath the ring of the willow tree, and the burning dusk beyond that, she leans into me and says, “Mark, it’s time.”\r\n\r\nI don’t need to think about it. “Have you?” I start. Susan finishes for me: “I stopped yesterday.”\r\n\r\nWhat can I say? The lawn is perfect. I tell Susan to stay where she is and I take Carlton through the beaded curtain of branches and into the house. I grab a thick blanket from the closet and walk to the back door. The last lights of the sun gone down are ebbing into black. “What do you think?” I ask Carlton. He is looking at me. He doesn’t say anything. I don’t expect him to. I pat his head. He’s getting older, but his fur is still pretty soft. “Stay,” I tell him. He knows what I mean.\r\n\r\nIt is more than the lawn, of course, though it surprises me how things like that weigh in on our most important decisions. Maybe because everything else is so intangible and hard to hold. It could be. I won’t pretend to know. I guess the best you can do is make everything as orderly as possible, clip the grass, and let it fly. Que sera, though it’s usually easier said than done. I pat Carlton’s head one last time.

(21, 'When My Body Smashed Into the Sidewalk', 'My last thought was this: I should have bought my mother a birthday present. Her birthday was the day before my jump and I didn’t even call her. I had seen the blackest blue necklace at the jewelry store storefront on the way to work but I didn’t have a chance to get it for her. I should have thought ahead.\r\n\r\nMy fall was 311 feet. 30 stories. 4.5 seconds. Terminal velocity is 120 miles per hour—the speed at which I was falling at the time of impact. When my body smashed into the ground, I was going so fast that a cloud of red smoke rose from my body—my blood turning into a gas, going through the blood vessel walls, through my smashed flesh, and hovering above my body as if a child had smacked two chalkboard erasers together. Poof.\r\n\r\nA woman who had just escaped the burning building from which I jumped saw my crash from 25 feet away. It was a thunderous bang my carcass made, and she covered her head with her hands, thinking a piece of the building had just fallen. But she did not look away. She stared at that thing beside her, because in her gut she knew it was important to see.\r\n\r\nI knew to jump the instant the fire got to my floor. The others went for the stairwell (and why not?), but I sensed something bad down there, I didn’t want to die in a smoky stairwell, I wanted to die speeding through the fresh air.\r\n\r\nNot knowing about the phenomenon I just described, she thought the cloud of blood above my crushed carcass was a soul, or it was a demon, she thought demons were escaping the scene, the horror of it, and this woman did what any sane person would do in that situation. She collapsed right on the sidewalk.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the man beside her was kind enough to pick her up—he was two inches shorter and twenty pounds smaller, but he picked her up and dragged her two blocks away from the scene, to a distance that was safe even when the 33-story building collapsed. The man was gone before she was conscious enough to notice him, and so he became another person lost in her dreams, a man whispering to her: it’s going to be all right, my god, it’s horrible, but it’ll be all right.\r\n\r\nWhen you have approximately two seconds to live and you know it, the wind against your ears is the most astonishing sensation.\r\n\r\nShe never spoke about the cloud above my crushed body to anyone, even during all her therapy, she refused to tell that part of the story, thinking to herself that she was cursed, and that was the only explanation for why she saw this ghost that no one else had seen. A therapist couldn’t save her from ghosts—not real ones.\r\n\r\nThe building wasn’t supposed to collapse, it was structurally sound. It wasn’t supposed to burn the way that it did. At first, they attributed it to terrorists (and who could blame them?). There was a lot of terror in the air, especially after what happened in New York. After all, “terrorism” has more punch to it than “faulty inductor in the wiring of an old Panasonic microwave oven.”\r\n\r\nThe woman who saw me crushed was named Noku. She was twenty-nine. She was no small woman, though she had the skinny fingers of her mother. Even though she was raised by her American father, it was her Japanese mother who named her before she disappeared six months after Noku was born. Noku has a memory of a woman, smelling of mint leaves, kissing her on the forehead and whispering to her, “Aishiteru.” She’d like to think that this was her mother saying to her, “I love you,” but a big part of her thinks it was just a dream.\r\n\r\nJumping out of a building isn’t as difficult as you’d guess. When I was a kid, I hated jumping off the high dive, the jump terrified me. It was the worst feeling in the world, all those seconds standing on that horrible, wobbly plank, feeling like that jump would kill me every time. All that shame while I stood there in front of everyone. Jumping out of a burning building was far easier—because it was not a bit harder.\r\n\r\nNoku had an abortion six months before the building collapsed. Her boyfriend drove her to and from the procedure, though he did not enter the clinic. He helped her into bed afterwards, but he didn’t stay at her apartment. Noku wanted the abortion just as much as he did, they were not ready, it was only six weeks along, and when her boyfriend broke up with her the next week, Noku was not disappointed, there was nothing left between them anyhow.\r\n\r\nMy mother and I didn’t get along the way I got along with my father. I worried about the possibility of my mother outliving my father and when it happened that way, I was disgusted with myself for thinking such thoughts. It’s not that I didn’t love her as much, it’s just that we always messed up the way we expressed ourselves. When she bought me a watch, I told her she should pay attention to the fact that I never wore watches. When I called her to say I missed her, she asked why I didn’t visit more often. We regretted but we didn’t mend.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t until she saw the ghost above my body that Noku felt regret for what she did at that clinic. As she was carried two blocks by the man she never met, she dreamed that she had a daughter, that the daughter was trapped inside the building, that it was her daughter who was supposed to survive, not Noku. What terrified her, was that in her dream, her daughter had a name.\r\n\r\nMy mother’s name is Tziona. It’s an Israeli name. When I was a child, she wasn’t happy living in this country. This was my father’s country, not hers. She was the seventh generation born in the Middle East and however foreign you might find the Middle East, my mother found Atlanta, Georgia at least that foreign—a camel isn’t nearly as bizarre as a highway with nine lanes in each direction. But she made due. She even grew to like this country. When my mother searched my apartment after I was crushed against the sidewalk, she found two pictures that I had framed without telling her. One was from 1972, with her carrying me in her arms, her big black hair and that beautiful smile. The other was in 1967, before I was born, of my mother carrying an Uzi and (once again) smiling for the camera, with the Negev desert behind her.\r\n\r\nNoku’s mother had nightmares every night since what she saw in 1945. In her dreams, all the people she knew were dark green shadows, and she was never able to touch them. She was terrified that Noku would also turn into a shadow. And so Noku’s mother disappeared, turning herself into a shadow.\r\n\r\nMy mother believes in God. She believes that the soul lives on forever. She even believes that the Bible is the real word of God. To my mother’s disappointment, I didn’t believe in God or the Bible. I didn’t believe in devils or demons or ghosts or saints. I didn’t believe that there was anything magical or mystical about that cloud of blood above my crushed body. I died, it was that simple, and the cloud was a scientifically-explainable phenomenon. There is life and there is death. But when Noku opened her journal two days later, she wrote, “I dreamed that I had a daughter named Tziona.”\r\n\r\nI might not believe in God, but I do believe in the power of words on a page. I even believe that a story can bring the dead to life. I have to believe that. I believe it just as much as I believe in the power of the wind against your ears at 120 miles per hour.\r\n\r\nNoku began writing more and more in her journal. After two years, the journal entries became more like stories than journal entries. After all, a journal is meant to be about real-world personal events, and most of her writing was about her non-existent daughter, who now had my mother’s name. On some days, she even wrote about me.\r\n\r\nShe wrote many stories. It became an obsession. Her writing was not what they call therapeutic—it sent her further into her already-too-far-inside-herself self. She rarely let another person see anything that she wrote. This obsession disturbed the few friends she had left. (How many hours could she possibly spend on that park bench with that worn out journal?) She squeezed the pencil so tightly that the ridges would disappear where her skinny index finger and skinny thumb touched the pencil.\r\n\r\nAt the instant I smashed into the sidewalk, I smelled like mint, like I had crumbled a leaf with my fingers and pressed it against my nose. This sensation was impossible to share and impossible to process—without an intact olfactory or nervous system.\r\n\r\nThe color that flashed in my head was the blackest blue. For a split second, I could see the world through the lens of that gem I should have gotten for my mother.\r\n\r\nIf my lips would’ve been able to utter a word, it would have been the word, “Tziona,” with that first syllable coming out like the chirp of a small bird. My mother made up the spelling of her name when she came to this country. “Your language doesn’t have the proper letters,” she told my father in 1971, with me still in her belly.\r\n\r\nNoku wrote obsessively until the time of her death. Her death came early but not painfully—it was just a dream that lasted too long. The day before she died, she mailed one of her stories to my old address—which came to her in a dream—and the letter ultimately landed in my mother’s lap, 181 days later. My mother didn’t open the letter for a long time, knowing that it would be more beautiful than any necklace. And when she did open it, she too believed that words could bring back the dead.', 'Yuvi Zalkow\'s work has been published in Rosebud, Ellipsis..., Storyglossia, The Clackamas Literary Review, and other magazines.

(22, 'Different Than Any Day So Far', 'Sometimes, I’ll put down the window as I drive to the shops and force as much wind into me as I can, until it burns my nose and puffs out my cheeks like I have a mouthful of marbles. They say I’ll get a chill soon and it won’t go away. But it hasn’t happened yet. My big coat works fine. I’ll stand the autumn breeze as long as anybody, then the heater inside has me shed down to a jumper in a second.\r\n\r\nVern let me drive after a while. He reckoned he’d been here long enough that I was as guilty as him. That would keep me from saying anything, he said, and he nodded, agreeing with his own logic there. In reality, it wasn’t like that anymore, between us. It hadn’t been for some time and I wanted to point that out to him. But I thought it better that such a thing settled in on him. He doesn’t like it when he thinks I’m convincing him of anything.\r\n\r\nIt’s been something like two months since I took Vern in. More. It doesn’t seem that long. He stopped ordering me around—announced that he’d stopped, anyway—after the second week. He asked if I believed him. I told him I didn’t know him well enough to doubt him. As always, time told. He did stop. Things were more exciting around here when he spouted orders. We became domestic after that.\r\n\r\nI wouldn’t have believed I’d lament another domestic situation. Had anybody asked me, I would’ve said that’s what I longed for. But this staring at the television, sharing chores that could wait or go undone altogether, and deliberating over the next meal as soon as the dishes were done—it was tiresome from the moment it began. The highlight of an evening might be a dusty old jigsaw puzzle with missing pieces. The bookshop in town keeps second-hand puzzles, swaps them out for no charge. I wish I had not told Vern that. And there were always the Sunday crosswords. A new one only five days away. Four. Three. There was so much potential, so much excitement; now, this.\r\n\r\nI was having a late dinner that night. It took me a year, you know, getting all my recipes pared down to where they would feed one person and not leave a mound of leftovers. I don’t eat at the table. Tonight it was meatloaf on my lap. I was watching that quiz show where you get kicked off, one at a time, if you’re stupider than the rest. Vern came in the front door during an advert, heaving, all rabbit-eyed. He needed me to be as scared as him. I think he was ashamed, or tired and not thinking clearly, jerking his head around and having a look at the place. He wanted to know if I was alone. I told him he’s the first to walk through that door in weeks. A kid named Kent delivered my shopping, but even he wouldn’t come all the way inside.\r\n\r\nThen Vern told me not to scream. An afterthought; he should’ve said that first. He was lucky. I had no intention of screaming. My throat hurt, and nobody lives within earshot anyway. He asked outright if I was scared. I stood, put my plate in the rocking chair and told him I could be, a bit, but I didn’t really know him well enough to be scared of him yet. That’s when he hit me. I didn’t cry out. Dale used to hit me much harder than Vern dared to. And Dale knew to hit me in the stomach where it wouldn’t raise questions.\r\n\r\nVern waited to see if his little slap did the trick. It can mean several things when a woman gets hit. Her man is drunk. Maybe he’s jealous, or he’s just mean, like Dale. So I told Vern I had to think about it, whether I was more scared or surprised. Then he tossed me about, tore my nightie. All I could think was that the sofa was moving in the ruckus and it hit the end table with my good lamp on it. Mother gave me that lamp, had it shipped back from Spain. I let out a gasp when I pictured the stained glass shade shattering on the floor. I think I said “oh, no” and Vern stopped. Satisfied.\r\n\r\nMen. If I could gather them all and tell them one thing, one thing they’d listen to, I would explain the difference between hopes and expectations. You’re all so used to getting what you expect. You say you hope this, you want that. But what you feel is a kind of entitlement. That makes it an expectation. Women hope. Some of us. We are the ones you like, because we don’t feel safe expecting what we hope for. Does this ring true? I never know who I’m talking to anymore.\r\n\r\nI asked Vern if he intended to rape me. I asked because I had nothing worth robbing and this was plainly evident from the road, even in the moonlight. It’s Darwinian out there. I own neither a lawn mower, hedge clippers, nor a fence. Vern said no, he just needed a place to sleep. He’d take my car and leave tomorrow night. He asked for the keys and I obliged. I told him I had AIDS, and the clutch was about to go on the car. He scoffed and said it wasn’t the first time he’d heard that one. I wondered which part he meant.\r\n\r\nWhen I told Dale I was sick, he said he always knew I couldn’t keep my knickers up. Dale left me a week later. Moved in with a woman who drives an Express Parcel van. I’ve never seen a naked man besides Dale. When he last phoned, asking if any post was still coming for him, I told him it was really hard to get the Ford into reverse. It seemed like it was in gear, but it wasn’t. He said it was the clutch.\r\n\r\nVern asked me that first night to show him where all the phones were. He unplugged both of them and kept them beside the chair where he eventually went to sleep. I told him to take the sofa, I would find him a blanket. He said no, and he moved Dale’s reclining chair to block the front door, then plopped down in it. I looked at the back door. Nothing at all in front of it. Before he dozed, Vern told me he wouldn’t tie me up. I said that was probably best. I have a small bladder. But, he said, he didn’t much mind killing me if I did anything stupid. Anything? Like keeping my doors unlocked? Or like sleeping with Dale when I could smell somebody else’s perfume on him?\r\n\r\nI offered Vern my meatloaf that night. His eyes flickered open and, in a voice slurred with exhaustion, he said he couldn’t eat. Neither could I. Something had chased the appetite from my belly. He fell fast asleep and left me thinking. I stared straight at the bridge of his nose. I thought, you—you will not make a victim of me. He had a nice nose. I’ll always think of his face the way it was that night. If nothing else, violently alive, even in sleep. I wondered what he might like for breakfast.\r\n\r\nAs Vern snored and twitched, the news interrupted the end of my quiz show with a flash about the prison escape, so I didn’t get to see who won the prize. Evidently, three inmates got out, and two were in custody. A description and black and white headshot of Vernon Stanmore popped up on the screen. It wasn’t a good likeness. He had that going for him. I couldn’t have picked him out in a crowd. The presenter advised all of us living close to the prison to lock our doors, something I would not have done anyway.\r\n\r\nAfterward, no channel wanted to air anything besides the fugitive story. Helicopters and spotlights. I could hear them outside occasionally. I only get three local channels. Two when there’s weather. It was a little stormy that night.\r\n\r\nI switched off the telly and turned my thoughts to Dale’s Express driver. I wondered if she had a good pension scheme and how close she might be to retirement. I worked for the same insurers twenty-two years and thought I had the best plan going, but it seems pathetic now. I took early retirement, and I can’t afford the homeopathic remedies, the ones they say work to put you at ease. That sounds pleasant, though I don’t think I’m ill at ease or in a state over my condition very much of the time.\r\n\r\nI can’t afford marijuana. They say that does something. But, I don’t want for much else. I want Dale to get around to divorcing me. I don’t have the patience for it, certainly not the money. The only thing worse than being legally tethered to Dale Bells is the thought of continuing to answer to Emmylou Bells. Somebody told me I could move to the southern US with my name, maybe Alabama, and be right at home. Mainly it was on my bills where I noticed it. Nobody had called me by name in a while.\r\n\r\nMy fugitive in the chair suddenly looked uncomfortable. He fled in his dreams. He wore a prison outfit with a number stencilled on it, unflattering and smelly. Maybe there was a purpose in keeping Dale’s clothes after all. When I was boxing things up in our flat, I thought I could make a nice quilt of the worn denim, wear his shirts as I tended my garden. Such a garden I would have, with all this spare time. Cabbage and lettuce galore. Some carrots and radishes, onions and garlic. Berries ringing the whole thing. Herbs, probably in a container. But there is no such thing as spare time. It’s not something we can spare. I studied Mr. Stanmore. Dale’s clothes would fit him.\r\n\r\nTomorrow, I thought, will be different than any day so far. And that was very good. This is the gift of terminal illness; the removal of guilt for thoughts like that. For flippancy. For anything, really. I didn’t much mind killing Vern either, whether he did anything I considered stupid or not. Here were two people, neither caring in the least if the other died. There’s a degree of stability in that, a foundation for something.\r\n\r\nOnce Vern got settled in, I would teach him to hope, something you can still do in the face of slim odds. That would be the next week, after it was clear I wasn’t his victim. Stop expecting it all to work out in the end, I’d tell him. Also, he needed better dialogue if he wanted to inspire fear. I had some books I could loan him. His face might be too kind to pull it off, though. Somebody needed to teach him real hardness if he intended to keep it up.\r\n\r\nI wondered if he minded being called Vern. I never liked the name Vernon. I would find out tomorrow. He could call me Emmy, like my brother used to.\r\n\r\nThe night he came was, let’s see, last week of September or so. I could still walk around the house in shirtsleeves, so it wasn’t October. A few days ago, I asked Vern (he doesn’t mind that name, says it sounds sweet when I say it) wouldn’t he like a Christmas tree? He didn’t look Jewish, but I could pick up some candles too, I said. We made a point, maybe a little game, of not asking questions unless we had to. Living in the day, he said. Yes, I agreed, living in the day. But that day we faltered.\r\n\r\n“Why are you doing this?” he asked me.\r\n\r\n“Because Christmas is just around the corner. I like the smell of a tree, even if there’s nothing under it.”\r\n\r\n“Keeping me, Emmy. Why do you let me stay here?”\r\n\r\n“You broke into my house. Don’t start with the questions. You’re the neediest fugitive I’ve ever known.” I should’ve just gone and come back with a tree.\r\n\r\n“Whatever,” he told me, and looked like he was going to pout. He does that. “You’re out of the shortbread I like. Are you going shopping?”\r\n\r\nObviously Kent couldn’t come by with my shopping anymore. That was a welcomed inconvenience. I hate that kid. And the driving does me good, I’m convinced.\r\n\r\n“Yes. And I’ll get us a tree,” I told him. He started toward the back garden. He had cleared it for me and sat there now in the afternoons, working his way through my old magazines. I said, “Vern?”\r\n\r\n“Yeah?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be sulky over Christmas.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll do my best. I miss walking around. I want to do things. Help out. Will you go to the chemist this time?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\nI watched Vern walk away. I knew he wanted to paint the house. It’s a beautiful little house, but it did need painting. I had started looking at the place from the road since I was driving again and mainly I thought, our flat bought all this. I used to think those words from inside my new house, but it was different. Standing at the window, seeing everything that needed to be done, I thought, this is all our flat bought. I tried to be grateful then that Dale at least left me the flat to sell. Whereas now, I was truly grateful he simply left.\r\n\r\nVern couldn’t paint my house. He couldn’t fix anything visible from the road. Most of the people in town have seen me at my worst. They would know it wasn’t me doing the work. Any of them who paid attention knew I couldn’t afford a handyman.\r\n\r\nVern was all I could think about as I drove to town the next day. He’s not more needy than he is caring. He is more clever than stupid, but there’s no telling which of those he’ll listen to at any given time. He’s accepted the fact that I don’t take the HIV medication from the chemist, but he doesn’t like it. We’ve had our philosophical arguments. I read him the literature on the drugs, where it implicitly states its mission to “retard the progression” of my condition. No hint of wellness as a goal. I told him that’s no reason to take drugs. He denounced me as a coward. I called him a despicable thief, and not a very good one. We were both right.\r\n\r\nHe’s seen me dizzy, tired for no reason, vomiting hard enough to steal my breath away, and feverish for days on end. I learned to tell the difference from his tone in the two ways he had of asking if I needed help. It’s good to understand things like that. He made me feel 100 years wise sometimes.\r\n\r\nWe didn’t kiss. I don’t know if the sickness was the only reason. It wasn’t a thing between us, though. Sex. I couldn’t sustain the desire and his equipment got smashed in prison. They didn’t fix it right, he said. I heard him cursing his body in the bathroom some mornings, bending to wipe up after himself. Then I would see him have a fit over a boiled egg that wouldn’t peel properly and it reminded me how young he was, how that kind of damage must torment him.\r\n\r\nI never asked him to kiss me because I didn’t want to make him say no, but he gave the most gorgeous backrubs. I wondered would those stop when I got lesions. We stopped talking about that early on—the point when he would become irksome to me and I would become disgusting to him. It only led to arguments. Then he began asking about the chemist. It made me wonder what was on his mind.\r\n\r\nThe narrow roads hereabout incessantly wind between bald green hills. There are no direct bits. Though you pass a paper’s thickness from other cars, you have to keep your eyes straight ahead, lest you plough a cyclist or some wandering livestock round the bend. At the edge of town that day, I remember thinking, nobody here ever waved to me. There were no bicycles or livestock in the shops, but the same rules seemed to apply to the aisles. Eyes straight ahead, no comment necessary. In town, I generally speak to only one person. His name is Michael. He runs the greengrocers.\r\n\r\nMichael said, “Your appetite’s back, Mrs. B. Good sign, that.”\r\n\r\n“Craving shortbread and hotdogs. Maybe I’m pregnant.” He didn’t get it. I said, “Looks like a cold snap moving in, don’t you think?”\r\n\r\n“Not especially.” He had onions to stack.\r\n\r\nThe car park across the street from the grocer was cordoned off in one corner, had evergreen trees lined up in rows and a man stood there wearing an apron and gloves, puffing out frosty breath and stomping his feet. I had Michael put the sacks in my back seat, then walked over to see the man about a tree. I wanted a fir. He had only monstrous firs, firs that would hold a tire swing and a tree-house.\r\n\r\n“Got just the tree for you. A good Scots pine.” He pointed to a hedge, murdered in its adolescence. It was straight, though, and a perfect shape. “Fit right on your roof there. And your Scots pine will go through to next Christmas and never lose a needle.”\r\n\r\nNot that it wasn’t a good choice for me. No conspicuous space at the bottom where gifts would be missed. It could be decorated in ten minutes. And, I might carry this tree alone. People would believe I could, anyway. She was a pert little thing. She was a she, and she was growing on me. Regardless, I couldn’t tarry. Vern got anxious. I paid the man and he strapped her on.\r\n\r\nOn the way back home, the corner of my mouth was burning. I tried licking it and it didn’t help. Whilst checking in the rear-view mirror for the beginnings of a cold sore, I rounded a corner and almost bowled into a lump of sheep. I put two wheels in the ditch without thinking and very nearly didn’t get them back onto the road. I felt a jolt and heard some thumps under the car. I heard a man yelling behind me and thought of a few words to yell back, had I the strength. The remainder of the drive, I wondered if Vern knew anything about cars. I’m relegated to the banger Dale left, a white Cortina that made enough strange noises on its own, without me swerving off-road during moments of senseless vanity. I needed this thing to last a while longer.\r\n\r\nVern said, “Yeah, all convicts can fix stuff. Pull in round the back where I can get the shopping out and I’ll have a look.”\r\n\r\nHe did. Laid on his back, he slid underneath the car and reported straight away there was a sheep grated-up and stuck in what he called the thingy between the wheel and this other thingy. He was shocked I didn’t notice the car pulling.\r\n\r\n“It always pulled,” I told him.\r\n\r\n“Whose sheep is it?”\r\n\r\nI didn’t get a chance to answer. The siren coming down the road had him off the ground and me in a dither in the same instant. I was glad the ice cream was already in the freezer—the extent of my critical thinking, never mind it was near freezing where I stood. Vern bolted inside.\r\n\r\nWhen my head cleared, I considered one way to go was to have Vern standing here beside me when the police pulled up. Tell them he was my cousin from—where? Somewhere. I seriously doubted they would still be looking for Vernon Stanmore around here, and doubted they would recognize him even so. We had dyed his hair and moustache black. My cooking had filled out his cheeks and his waistline since the night he showed up. Chances are, there wouldn’t have been a suspicious thing about him, unless they found him in a wardrobe. It was too late to say all that now, though. Here came the blue lights.\r\n\r\nTwo officers got out of the car and walked toward me. I recognised one. Having no luck finding the third escaped convict on the night of the prison break, they’d come round house to house two days after. Handing out fliers, asking questions. The fliers had the same photo of Vern they had shown on the news. I still didn’t think it looked much like him, but Vern did answer to the name. That morning, I told this particular officer that I’d seen nobody who looked like the picture. He didn’t ask if there was a man in my house answering to the name.\r\n\r\nThis day, he said, “Mrs. Bells.”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“A sheep was hit up the road. The owner described a car like yours. Your number plate, evidently.”\r\n\r\n“That’s because I hit it. It’s under there.” I pointed.\r\n\r\n“You didn’t stop.”\r\n\r\n“Didn’t know I hit it.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Stewart says it was not in the road.”\r\n\r\n“I think he’s right. Is he the shepherd? Do you call them shepherds? I swerved into the ditch to miss the rest of his flock.”\r\n\r\nThe other policeman was down on his knees now, peering under my car.\r\n\r\n“That being the case,” said this one in front of me, “can you pay for the animal?”\r\n\r\n“Probably not. I don’t know how much a sheep costs. I know I couldn’t afford that much mutton. I can pay him a little each month, as my pension cheque comes in.”\r\n\r\n“Pensioner, then,” says the other one, dusting off his knees. He repeated it like it settled some bet at the pub. “Yep, it’s a sheep under there. Most of one.” Then he said, “Wouldn’t have guessed you were a pensioner. Nothing wrong with that. It’s just that you’re young.”\r\n\r\nHe must’ve lost the bet.\r\n\r\nI said, “You’re so kind. Would you like to go out sometime, maybe dinner? Fever’s let up and I haven’t had a spell lately.”\r\n\r\n“Can’t, no. Thank you.”\r\n\r\n“Suit yourself.”\r\n\r\nThe other one said, “I don’t see any need for formal charges. Mr. Stewart says it wasn’t a special sheep.” He scribbled something on his flip pad and tore out the page, handed it to me. “Call him up. Nice enough fella. Tell him you’ll make good. Yeah?”\r\n\r\n“Yeah.”\r\n\r\nThey were gone. I fainted in the driveway. Can’t say I wasn’t warned about this fainting. It’s still frightening, though. I awoke inside. Vern apologized over and over, wiping my face and covering me with my gran’s quilts until I couldn’t move under the weight.\r\n\r\n“What, Vern? What?”\r\n\r\n“I had to leave you out there a whole twenty minutes.” He was nearly crying. “Could hardly stand it, Emmy, but the police car was sat in the road for bleedin’ ages. I thought they’d set up camp. I couldn’t come out to get you. I couldn’t. I’m sorry.”\r\n\r\n“It’s just a little swoon, Vern. Not a big deal. Low blood sugar, low blood pressure, something like that. It’ll happen. I’m alright.”\r\n\r\n“Not really. You’ve hit your head back here. Does it hurt? Take these aspirin.”\r\n\r\nI felt around until I found the spot. “No. It’s only a bump.”\r\n\r\n“You could use a good shampoo and maybe a haircut. Can I do that for you? A nice hot salt bath for your feet, huh?”\r\n\r\n“My hair?”\r\n\r\n“That’s what I done inside, Emmy. Got no experience at all with sheep crammed up under cars, but I cut hair for years. I’m a pretty good barber.”\r\n\r\nHe stood in front of me, smiling slightly, turning his head this way and that. He’d cut his own hair while I was gone. It looked alright. Something else looked different about him, but it wouldn’t come clear to me what it was. He looked quite nice.\r\n\r\n“I’ll let you cut my hair. I need to get the tree off my car first.”\r\n\r\n“Let me do it.”\r\n\r\n“No. Stay inside. I don’t want to risk it now.”\r\n\r\nI had the tree in the corner near the telly. Broke some limbs off her because I had to drag her a bit, but I turned that side toward the wall. I stood there trying to remember where my decorations were. Vern came up behind me with a sheet and a pair of scissors, my sewing scissors.\r\n\r\n“Okay, the tree’s in. Now have a seat and let’s get on with your hair. I’ll make up a pan of salts.”\r\n\r\n“You shouldn’t have your hands in my hair if I’m bleeding, Vern.” I felt the bump on my head again and looked at my hand.\r\n\r\n“You only bled a drop. I cleaned it up. No worries. Sit yourself down.”\r\n\r\nI did. “Where did you find those clothes? I haven’t seen them in years.”\r\n\r\nHe wore what Dale used to wear to church, when we used to go. A deep green jumper over a white oxford shirt, charcoal trousers cuffed at the bottom.\r\n\r\n“In the utility room, under your sewing kit,” he said. “Should I take ‘em off?”\r\n\r\n“No. They’re fine. Got nothing else to do with the stuff.” Then, “That didn’t come out like I planned. I’m glad you found them. They look—You look nice. The boots fit too?”\r\n\r\n“They’re big. Not too big. I got on two socks.”\r\n\r\nHe disappeared into the kitchen and returned minutes later with one of my pans, steaming with water. I smelled the salt as he bent and placed it at my feet. He untied my trainers, rolled up my jeans, and eased my feet in.\r\n\r\n“Too hot?”\r\n\r\n“Just perfect.”\r\n\r\nThen he stood behind me, draped the sheet around my neck, and ran both his hands through my hair, slowly, stopping to work out any tangles. The light pressure on my scalp gave me goose bumps. I looked up and saw he had the scissors in his teeth. He winked at me.\r\n\r\n“Head forward,” he said, around the scissors.\r\n\r\nThen he massaged my temples, around my ears. I had forgotten touch like that. I never want to forget it again. I dozed off to the squeak-chirp of the scissors, the gentle tug as he took hair between his fingers and straightened it. I woke several times to his chuckling. He would take my forehead in his palm and raise my head when it nodded. I listened to the ticking of the wall clock and thoroughly enjoyed myself.\r\n\r\n“I think they’re under my bed,” I mumbled.\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“The Christmas tree ornaments. I know they are. You know what else is there?”\r\n\r\n“No. What else?”\r\n\r\nHe was in front of me now, straddling my knees, working on my fringe. My eyes were closed, but I could still see that green jumper and his black moustache above it.\r\n\r\n“Some paintings. Art from my old flat. Dale bought them, or traded for them. I never much cared for paintings, but I know the frames are good ones.”\r\n\r\n“I peeled some potatoes while you were gone, and put a roast in. We’ll eat, then you have a nap. I’ll hang your pictures tonight.”\r\n\r\n“That’s sweet. I don’t want to hang them, though. That’s why they’re under the bed. There’s a little art shop in town. I bet I could get a hundred pounds for the frames alone. Who knows, maybe Dale had an eye for art.”\r\n\r\n“Wouldn’t that be something. Fine art under your bed.”\r\n\r\n“And I’m quite certain I have too many Christmas baubles, seven times over. Now would be the time to sell those, maybe in the car park beside the tree man. He might buy them. We’ll put my favourite ones on her and take the rest to town.”\r\n\r\n“Her?”\r\n\r\n“Our tree.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll take the rest to town, you mean. Here.” I opened my eyes and he handed me a mirror. “What do you think?”\r\n\r\n“It’s superb. Thank you, sir.” I wanted to stand up and hug him, but my feet were in a pan. “We can take a trip, and there’s no reason on Earth you can’t go. Nobody will recognise you, Vern. I’ll think of something else to call you. How’s Bill?”\r\n\r\nHe went to the bathroom and came back with a towel. He lifted my feet, one at a time, and dried them, then he took the pan into the kitchen.\r\n\r\n“Maybe not Bill. I have a number for this herbalist in Edinburgh,” I said, standing to brush the hair off. When Vern came back into the sitting room, he had a broom. “I want to sell all this junk of Dale’s, everything you can’t use. Some other stuff too. I have too much. I want to see what those herb remedies do. We’ll have enough for a nice hotel. What’s marijuana like?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve never smoked weed, Emmy.” He put my chair back where it went and swept the rug. “You want a shower?”\r\n\r\n“No, damn it. I want to smoke marijuana. I want a nice hotel in Edinburgh, and a good meal. Let’s get all the junk piled in the sitting room and see what we’ve got to work with. I’m up for another trip to town, if the car will make it.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t want the roast and potatoes?”\r\n\r\n“You’re not listening, Vern. We can go! We can. I’ll call you Matthew. You look like a Matthew now.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve already peeled all your potatoes.” He walked away with the broom. From the utility room, he said, “You can go, Emmy. It’s a fine idea.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\nHe walked back to me with a slack pace, but his jaw was set. It took him a moment to find my eyes.\r\n\r\nFinally, he said, “I’ve been in three prisons since I was eighteen. This is number four. It’s the nicest prison yet, for a fact. But it’s still prison, Emmy.”\r\n\r\nHe let that fall on me and didn’t promise with a look or a gesture that he’d offer any help handling it.\r\n\r\n“Stop it, Vern.”\r\n\r\n“Were you thinking I would stay with you forever?”\r\n\r\n“No. Yes. You’ll get caught.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe. I will go by Matthew. I’ll get as far as I can.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t take my car. Please.” I say things like that sometimes and I know, as they are coming from my mouth, that I will cry over them later.\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t. I’ll get that sheep out of it, though.”\r\n\r\nHe did. He changed into a set of Dale’s threadbare overalls and worked out there for the better part of an hour. Said he buried it so it wouldn’t smell. All that time, I sat in my rocking chair and held the green jumper in my lap until he’d showered and came to put it on again. By that time it was getting dark.\r\n\r\nVernon Stanmore came in through my front door, and Matthew Something left through my back door, but he was the same person. It’s either very unlucky to do that, or it’s very unlucky to do it any other way. Someone told me that once.\r\n\r\nFor three days, I walked the path he had taken through the field behind my house, keeping the grass and weeds trodden down for some reason. I walked until I grew tired, then I sat a while. I got up and walked farther, until I could hardly see my house. I made my way back and watched his path until it became insufferably cold in the evening, no matter what I draped over myself. I skipped the fourth day because I couldn’t get out of bed. I think it was the onset of a cold.\r\n\r\nI forced my way to the porch on the fifth day and my heart started racing. I could make out only the faintest notion of the path, broken in places, and the toughest weeds were straightening even as I stared at them. I took off as fast as I could move, coughing, dragging my feet to lay the grass down hard. I had to stop and find where I thought the path went a couple of times, and to catch my breath. Shortly after I remembered I was wearing only a dressing gown and slippers, I fainted. I woke up no more than three hundred feet from my back door. My fingernails were blue. There was my own path leading back to the porch, and nothing but a winter field in all other directions.\r\n\r\nI got to my feet and saw a man walking around the corner of my house. He called to me, and met me halfway to my porch.\r\n\r\n“You’re not fit to be out in this, Mrs. Bells! You’re all ice.”\r\n\r\n“I did notice a slight chill.”\r\n\r\n“My lord, what were you thinking? Let’s get you inside.”\r\n\r\nHe introduced himself as he piled my gran’s quilts over me. The weight of them pressed me into the sofa. His name was Arlow Stewart.\r\n\r\n“Arlow is a strange name.” My chattering teeth must’ve rattled any manners out of my head.\r\n\r\n“It is. Don’t hear too many women answer to Emmylou Bells these days either.”\r\n\r\n“It’s not mine.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s nice. Can I get you a cup of tea?”\r\n\r\n“No. Thank you.” Then I recognized his name. “It was your sheep I hit.”\r\n\r\n“It was. I come by yesterday to demand payment for it. Ready to phone the police back. They said you would phone me.”\r\n\r\n“I would have done. I was sick.”\r\n\r\n“I know, Mrs. Bells. I was in town last night and they told me. I don’t want you worrying about that sheep. I’ve got more. That’s what I come to tell you today.”\r\n\r\n“What day is it today?”\r\n\r\n“It’s Saturday. Let me get you something warm to drink. Might do you good, Missus.”\r\n\r\n“It doesn’t feel like a Saturday, does it?”\r\n\r\n“Right. Maybe not. Some tea, then?”\r\n\r\nSuch a nice man. A little older. He was only agreeing with me because he thought that’s what I was hoping to hear. Saturday is just Saturday.

(23, 'One Hundred Santas', 'Gilbert Marvel’s first Christmas screenplay was called Behold! In it a teenaged plain Jane works as a seasonal elf at the local department store. The star quarterback of her high school comes into the store one night after consuming a half-liter of vodka with the team’s wide receiver. The receiver says he will give the quarterback twenty bucks if he gets his picture taken on Santa’s lap. As he waits in line the quarterback fills out a Christmas list questionnaire. In a flash of sobriety he writes, on the list, that what he wants for Christmas is for his folks to reunite.\r\n\r\nThe next day in study hall Jane passes Quarterback a note suggesting that, in order to see his wish come true, he give each of his parents a lavish gift on Christmas Day and say it is from the other. You never know, she writes at the end of the note.\r\n\r\nLuckily young Joe Heisman has a charge card that Dad pays the bills on without question. When Mom and Dad open their ruby bracelet and Alpaca-lined briefcase, respectively, there is a brief pause before Christmas magic takes hold. Love and holiday cheer fill their hearts. They reunite. In his gratitude Quarterback asks Jane to the holiday formal. She gets a makeover from the tarty cosmetics cashier with the heart of gold and, under the light of the gym’s electric blue mistletoe, Jane and Quarterback’s lips meet in a holiday kiss to end all holiday kisses.\r\n\r\nGilbert wrote it ten years ago.\r\n\r\nGilbert Marvel did not celebrate Christmas as a child. His mother was Jewish. His father was raised Catholic, however a college-era allegiance with the Communist party caused him to sever all ties with organized religion before Gilbert was born.\r\n\r\nGrowing up in the East Village of Manhattan, Gilbert and his younger brother Samuel spent Christmas Eve opening Hanukkah presents. On Christmas Day the family would go to lunch in Chinatown.\r\n\r\nGilbert never craved a Christmas tree, gingerbread house, or stockings hung by the chimney with care. He never desired to sing carols or receive more than his one, token Hanukkah gift.\r\n\r\nThe one thing Gilbert did want and in fact could not get enough of was Christmas stories. His first taste of them was the televised, stop motion animation version of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. Gilbert sat glued to the television for the entire half hour. Gilbert, a normally well-behaved child, cried when his mother told him it would be another year before they aired Rudolph again.\r\n\r\nThe next week he discovered Frosty the Snowman. When Gilbert was told that it too would not be shown for another year again there was a wail. By the time he saw The Grinch That Stole Christmas his mother lied and said it would re-air in a month. She assumed that in a month’s time Gilbert would forget about it and indeed about his strange obsession with Christmas stories in general. But a month later Gilbert parked himself in front of the television and proceeded to throw a temper tantrum when his mother said that, in fact, the Grinch would not be on until the following Christmas season.\r\n\r\nThe next year Gilbert came across A Miracle on 34th Street. He watched it the weekend after Thanksgiving and then called the local TV station over and over again until they would tell him when it would be on again. By the time Christmas came around that year he had seen it six times.\r\n\r\nThe next year he discovered A Christmas Carol, White Christmas, and A Christmas Story. Then, for Hanukkah in his freshman year of high school his mother gave Gilbert a gift that he would, for years to come, describe as the best he had ever received: his own VHS copy of It’s A Wonderful Life.\r\n\r\n“You turd, Gilbert,” Samuel said once when he discovered Gilbert watching White Christmas for the second time in a random week in July, “We don’t even celebrate Christmas.”\r\n\r\nGilbert never bothered to explain himself in moments such as these. He knew his family both did not and would not understand. Had he been forced to, though, he would have said it was because of the magic of Christmas.\r\n\r\nUnlike other kinds of stories, where characters have to overcome various obstacles, fight battles between good and evil, or go on journeys forcing them to face their deepest fears before making their way back home, in Christmas stories a larger force is at work. Yes characters have to jump through hoops to get from point A to point B, but in the end any great Christmas story comes down to the universe’s mystical ability to resolve all problems in the month between Thanksgiving and Christmas.\r\n\r\nThe maxim had proven true in Gilbert’s real life as well. Ever since that first viewing of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, any angst he might have been feeling had, magically, dissipated in the Christmas season. In this time of year Gilbert could watch Christ-mas movies at will without threat of recrimination by family members. But really, Gilbert believed, it was because of the magic of Christmas.\r\n\r\nSo it came to pass that as Gilbert Marvel made his way through high school and college and then out into the working world he fostered one life goal: to write the next great American Christmas movie.\r\n\r\nHe wrote Behold! when he was twenty-two. It was the year after he graduated from City College. He was still living with his parents and working at the newsstand.\r\n\r\nBut great art does not always meet with great support. Gilbert had trouble finding a producer to buy his script. There was one main problem, which was that he didn’t actually know any Hollywood producers. Nor any people working in the film industry, for that matter. He signed up for a seminar at the Learning Annex called “How to Make Your Screenplay A Blockbuster.”\r\n\r\nWhen he pitched Behold! to the freelance TV producer running the seminar, however, the producer was less than excited.\r\n\r\n“It’s a little commercial, don’t you think?” she said.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” Gilbert asked.\r\n\r\n“The message. The parents get back together because of the expensive gifts?”\r\n\r\n“No they get back together because of the magic of Christmas.”\r\n\r\n“As translated through expensive gifts.”\r\n\r\nGilbert said nothing.\r\n\r\nShe sighed.\r\n\r\n“I’d work on that angle if I were you.”\r\n\r\nGilbert left early.\r\n\r\nA month later Gilbert’s parents told him it was high time he get a real job and his own apartment.\r\n\r\n“Stop with this meshugenah screenwriting, Gilbert,” his mother said, “Go to law school.”\r\n\r\n “As a matter of fact I have a job lined up, mother,” he said, “In the film industry.”\r\n\r\nShe eyed him skeptically.\r\n\r\n“What kind of job, Gilbert?”\r\n\r\nA week later Gilbert began working behind the counter at Kim’s Video in the West Village. He manned the Miscellaneous counter where, along with Christmas movies, one could find cartoon features, nature specials, and international soft-core porn, the latter of which was kept in unmarked boxes and had to be asked for by name.\r\n\r\nHis co-worker Ritchie, a punk rocker who specialized in foreign film, enjoyed ribbing Gilbert about his lack of diversity in cinematic expertise.\r\n\r\n“You need to branch out, G. Learn about flicks other than Christmas,” he said.\r\n\r\nGilbert waved him off, shook his head, and went back to dusting off the covers of the Christmas movie boxes. In the eleven-month off-season they were not exactly in high demand.\r\n\r\nGilbert moved out of his parents’ apartment and into a small studio on the lower east side. He furnished it with a mattress, milk crates, and a forty-inch TV.\r\n\r\nA few months after moving into this apartment and several more fruitless attempts to find a buyer for Behold!later, Gilbert came up with the idea for his second Christmas screenplay.\r\n\r\nAs much as he had found her to be a self-important ignoramus, Gilbert had the words of the woman from the Learning Annex seminar in mind when he got down to work: Message.\r\n\r\nNoel was about a single mother of two who works as a waitress and has an addiction to online gambling. When the movie opens, her addiction has gotten so bad that she starts missing mortgage payments. When a wealthy patron begins to frequent the diner where she works, she decides to get him to fall for her using the oldest trick in the book: jealousy. A male friend of hers comes into the diner and pretends to be her boyfriend. Her plan succeeds on Christmas Eve Day, when, after she engineers a fight with her faux boyfriend, the wealthy patron tells her he is in love with her. He pays off her mortgage and they get married in Vegas.\r\n\r\nRitchie said nothing after he read the script.\r\n\r\nGilbert sat and waited proudly. He could almost hear Ritchie saying the words he knew would one day come his way, “The best Christmas story ever told.”\r\n\r\n“Hmm,” is what Ritchie said.\r\n\r\n“Hmmm?” Gilbert repeated.\r\n\r\n“Well,” Ritchie began, “I mean, dude, I totally dig that you finished a screenplay. That’s rad.”\r\n\r\n“Two, actually. I’ve written two,” Gilbert said.\r\n\r\n“Yeah. That’s awesome.”\r\n\r\n“But?”\r\n\r\n“Can I be honest?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Gilbert said.\r\n\r\nRitchie paused for a moment.\r\n\r\n“Your main character is a sleaze. She’s got two kids and spends all her time in online gambling rooms. Then she spots this dude and, like, entraps him so he’ll bail her out. She’s a ho, man.”\r\n\r\n“She’s a modern protagonist,” Gilbert said.\r\n\r\n“Maybe, but, I dunno, I wasn’t feeling the love.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps what you’re not feeling is the Christmas spirit.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps.”\r\n\r\nGilbert sent copies of Noel to all the production companies he could find in Kim’s back catalogues. Two weeks later his manager marched Gilbert into the back office and informed him that these companies were in fact only responsible for the production of video and had nothing to do with screenplays for original features. Furthermore, the manager added, it was inappropriate for Gilbert to be sending his “drek” to them.\r\n\r\nRitchie guided Gilbert to the local Barnes and Noble, where they spent an hour poring over books on selling screenplays. In the next week Gilbert sent copies of Behold! and Noel to thirty of the agents he and Ritchie found in the books.\r\n\r\nOver the course of the next year, as he waited to hear back from them, Gilbert came up with another idea for a Christmas screenplay. Faith was about the year Santa decided to become a Scientologist but, at the last minute, renounced his newfound faith due to Mrs. Claus’ long-time struggle with manic depression and Santa’s realization that Prozac has, in fact, saved his marriage.\r\n\r\nRitchie never got back to him with his feedback on Faith.\r\n\r\nJoy came the next year. In it, a rich but lonely man meets a hooker with a heart of gold a week before Christmas. She will not, however, give him her phone number. He bribes her pimp with Christmas presents for the pimp’s entire family. The pimp gives the rich man the number. The rich man finds her on Christmas Eve, they fall in love, and live happily ever after.\r\n\r\nFor Christmas that year Ritchie gave Gilbert a book on the art of creating drama.\r\n\r\nBy the time he was thirty-four Gilbert had been out of college for twelve years. He had been working at Kim’s for ten of them and had completed seven and a half Christmas screenplays.\r\n\r\nRitchie’s band had been signed and dropped from two labels. Two years prior Ritchie had knocked up his girlfriend Katya. Gilbert was the witness when they married at City Hall.\r\n\r\nOne year prior Gilbert’s father had taken ill with prostate cancer. In order to care for him Gilbert’s mother sold the newsstand to a family of Pakistani immigrants. Samuel had graduated from Hunter, gotten a degree in education, and become a high school Biology teacher in Brooklyn.\r\n\r\nIt was in the year that Gilbert’s father’s treatments stopped working, Samuel got tenure, Ritchie’s daughter took her first step, and Gilbert’s eighth Christmas screenplay was mailed back to him, unopened, by fifteen agents, that Gilbert fell in love.\r\n\r\nJillie Sloane was an actress. She moved to New York from Iowa City, Iowa, where her father was a professor of Sociology at the university and her mother taught kindergarten. Jillie was the biggest star of the stage her high school had ever seen. She snagged the lead in all but one of the productions she auditioned for at the University of Iowa.\r\n\r\nJillie moved into the studio apartment below Gilbert’s a month before his thirty-fifth birthday. As a New York City resident Gilbert saw beautiful women all the time but Jillie’s proximity made her different. She was of medium height and perfect build: not an ounce overweight but not too skinny either. She had thick, blond hair that just reached her shoulder blades. Her eyes were large and blue. It took Gilbert a month to realize that one was larger than the other. They spoke for the first time in the laundry room of the apartment building three days after Gilbert first spotted her.\r\n\r\nWithin weeks of Jillie’s moving in, Gilbert took to huddling by the window of his apartment on the days Jillie went grocery shopping. Then, when he saw her coming, he would bop down the stairs of the walk-up and help her carry her bags to her apartment. After a few months of him helping her Jillie began inviting Gilbert inside for dinner afterwards. The meals would usually consist of a can of Chef Boyardee, sliced tomatoes, a couple of beers and maybe some ice cream, but Gilbert would tell Ritchie the day after that Jillie was the best cook he had ever known.\r\n\r\n“Ask her out, man,” Ritchie said after the first time Gilbert told him about one of the dinners, “Take the girl on a real date.”\r\n\r\nGilbert shook his head no.\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t pollute our relationship with such antiquated rituals,” he said.\r\n\r\nJillie quickly discovered that being a star in Iowa City did not hold much water in the shark-infested sea of New York City. In her first year she got three callbacks for commercials and one for a play. One of the commercials called her back a second time. In the waiting room outside the casting director’s office she spied a blond of medium height who could have been her twin sister. Six months later, while channel surfing, Jillie saw the blonde in the commercial for which they had both auditioned.\r\n\r\nAn agent Jillie got a meeting with told Jillie the problem was that she, Jillie, was too All-American looking.\r\n\r\n“These days directors want exotic, multi-ethnic. I get a call a day for Eurasians. But Marcia Brady? Not so much.”\r\n\r\nThat night over dinner Jillie downed a fifth of Scotch. Gilbert carried her to her bed and cleaned up the kitchen. He then went back down to his apartment and changed the physical description of every woman in his current Christmas screenplay to blond and blue-eyed. This way, Gilbert thought, Jillie and I will get our big breaks at the exact same time.\r\n\r\nOver the course of the next year Gilbert completed his ninth Christmas screenplay and Jillie continued to chase her dream of being an actress. Week after week she trudged off to auditions. Week after week she swallowed rejection. Gilbert came to recognize how her day had gone by the pace with which she approached the apartment building after work.\r\n\r\nQuickly meant she had an audition the next day or had just read about a casting call where the directors were looking for All-American blondes. Slowly meant she had not gotten the call she had been hoping to get that day or had gotten it and the answer had been no. Gilbert noticed, after Jillie had been in the city for about a year and a half, that it was the latter more than the former he observed as she made her way home.\r\n\r\nHe also noticed an increase in her drinking on the nights they got together for dinner. What had once been a beer or two became large glasses of Scotch, followed at times by a half six pack as Gilbert and Jillie sat and watched old movies and she lamented the heyday of actresses who look like Doris Day and Donna Reed.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time Jillie brought men home. Most of the time, from what Gilbert could overhear in the conversations they had while walking up to the building, they were men she had waited on at the restaurant, or fellow actors who had picked her up at auditions. Gilbert didn’t sleep a wink the nights these fellows slept over. He would pour his own glass of Scotch and then drown out the noise from below with Christmas movies played at high volumes.\r\n\r\nRitchie happened to be over on one of these nights. He observed Gilbert spy Jillie from the window, eavesdrop on her conversation, pop in It’s a Wonderful Life, and turn the volume up to nine.\r\n\r\n“This is wack, G.”\r\n\r\n“Shut up, Ritchie.”\r\n\r\n“I’m serious, dude. You need to make a move on this chick. Tell her how you feel.”\r\n\r\nGilbert looked at Ritchie but said nothing.\r\n\r\nThings never went anywhere with any of the men Jillie brought home. They might make one or two more appearances but never more than that. Gilbert knew this was because, secretly, Jillie was every bit as in love with him as he was with her. She might be using these other men for quick, carnal satisfaction but, ultimately, Gilbert was her soul mate, her one and only love.\r\n\r\nA few weeks after the night Ritchie watched him listen in on her and another man, Jillie got particularly drunk over the pizza she shared with Gilbert. That day no less than three casting directors had told her she was not right for their projects.\r\n\r\nAs Gilbert carried her to her bed, Jillie put her hand on his arm.\r\n\r\n“Gilbert,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\nHer hand lingered there. Gilbert felt a tickle run up his spine. It moved down to his kneecaps, which, all of a sudden, felt numb.\r\n\r\n“Thanks Gilbert.”\r\n\r\nThen she passed out.\r\n\r\nGilbert found himself in his apartment about ten minutes later. He could not remember how he had gotten there.\r\n\r\nGilbert turned thirty-six a week shy of Thanksgiving. A week later came Black Friday, the official start of the Christmas season and, traditionally, Gilbert’s favorite day of the year. In honor of it he wrote the last scene of his tenth Christmas screenplay. He then spent three weeks refining it. It was called Mitzvahs for Christmas and was about a streak of good luck that befalls a rabbi during the Christmas season.\r\n\r\n“But G,” Ritchie said, “Rabbis don’t believe in Christmas.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps not,” Gilbert said, “But they can still benefit from the magic of it.”\r\n\r\nThe next day Gilbert did not see Jillie head off to work at her normal hour. He went down to her apartment a little while later and knocked on the door. After ten minutes he was turning to go upstairs when the door opened a crack. On the other side of it Gilbert could see Jillie in sweatpants and a T-shirt. Her hair hung from her head in stringy heaps.\r\n\r\n“Not going to work today?” Gilbert said.\r\n\r\nJillie shook her head.\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\nShe paused.\r\n\r\n“I’m tired, Gilbert,” she said, “I couldn’t fall asleep last night.”\r\n\r\nThe word “Okay” was only halfway out of Gilbert’s mouth when Jillie shut the door.\r\n\r\nThat day Gilbert came home from work with a chicken breast, carrots, and bouillon cubes. He got down to the business of making chicken stew as soon as he walked in the door. It was one of the few things his mother made with frequency when he was a child. He knew the recipe by heart.\r\n\r\nHe brought a pot down to Jillie’s at dinnertime. But after knocking on the door for five minutes and then waiting another five there was still no answer. Finally Gilbert left the pot by the door along with a note in the crack that read “Jillie, open the door for dinner.”\r\n\r\nThe next morning when Gilbert rolled over he saw that the large hand of his clock was on the seven. His alarm was not set to go off before eight.\r\n\r\nThat was when he heard sirens outside. They had been what woke him a minute ago. They’re close, he thought. He went to the window, looked out, and saw an ambulance.\r\n\r\nHis first thought was of Mrs. Myers. She was an octogenarian widow who lived on the top floor of his building. She still got around but Gilbert nonetheless helped her with packages and groceries whenever he could.\r\n\r\nThe paramedics were carrying a stretcher out the front door of the building. Gilbert strained. He pushed his curtain back. And then he saw it: a spill of blond hair over one side of the stretcher.\r\n\r\nIn under a minute he was out the front door of the building. The paramedics were closing the back door of the ambulance when he reached it.\r\n\r\n“What happened?” Gilbert said.\r\n\r\n“We have to go,” the driver said. He walked to the front of the ambulance.\r\n\r\n“What happened to Jillie!?” Gilbert said.\r\n\r\nThe driver started to close the door but something in Gilbert’s voice made him, without breaking his movement, turn and look Gilbert in the eye.\r\n\r\n“Sleeping pills and Scotch. She’ll be at St. Vincent’s.”\r\n\r\nJillie had called 911 before passing out but hadn’t remained conscious long enough to speak.\r\n\r\n“When that happens, it’s often an OD,” the nurse told Gilbert.\r\n\r\nIn a corner of the waiting room there was a tree. It was adorned with white lights. Next to it there was a large, plastic menorah.\r\n\r\nAfter getting her stomach pumped, Jillie rested in the ICU. The nurses did not want to rouse her so Gilbert went back to the apartment building to seek out her parents’ number in Iowa.\r\n\r\nGilbert did not know to lie and say he was a family member. However as Jillie had no other visitors, the doctor allowed him in when she woke up a little while later.\r\n\r\nJillie had her hands folded over her stomach. She looked at Gilbert but said nothing. He sat in the chair next to her bed.\r\n\r\n“Thank you for the chicken soup, Gilbert,” she said, finally.\r\n\r\nGilbert nodded. He reached over and put his hand on the foot of the bed close to where the outline of Jillie’s legs could be seen through the blanket.\r\n\r\n“It’s almost Christmas, Jillie,” he said.\r\n\r\nThen Jillie spoke three words that would change Gilbert’s life forever.\r\n\r\n“I know, Gilbert.”\r\n\r\nAt one in the morning Gilbert was asleep in a chair in the waiting room when he woke to a nurse touching his shoulder. Behind her there was a doctor. Over their shoulders Gilbert could see the Christmas tree and menorah. The doctor had a strange look on his face.\r\n\r\nRitchie offered to drive to Iowa City with him but Gilbert refused.\r\n\r\n“You should be with Katya for Christmas,” Gilbert said.\r\n\r\nThe date was December the 22nd.\r\n\r\nWhen they got word of her overdose, Jillie’s parents had purchased tickets for New York immediately. That day, however, a blizzard hit Iowa City that lingered for two days. All flights were grounded.\r\n\r\nJillie went into cardiac arrest and died an hour after Gilbert spoke with her. Her parents had her body sent to Iowa City on the first flight that could get out. Between the blizzard and the holidays, they decided to wait a week before going to New York to pack up Jillie’s apartment. The wake for Jillie would be held in Iowa City two days before Christmas. She would be buried on Christmas Eve day.\r\n\r\nBefore he set out on his drive, Gilbert got the superintendent, Mr. Hernandez, to let him into Jillie’s apartment. Once inside he went to the nightstand, opened it, and took out a medium-sized notebook with a blue sky and clouds on the cover.\r\n\r\nGilbert arrived in Iowa City at midday on the 23rd. The wake was just beginning.\r\n\r\nThe crowd at the wake consisted of Jillie’s family and about ten friends from high school and college. Gilbert was the only friend from New York.\r\n\r\nJillie’s mother grasped Gilbert’s hand in hers when he expressed his condolences.\r\n\r\n“It was so kind of you to come here all the way from New York,” she said.\r\n\r\nGilbert nodded. There were things, many of them, on the tip of his tongue. But nothing came out.\r\n\r\nFor the rest of the wake he sat quietly in a corner and listened to Jillie’s theater friends from college tell stories about plays they had done with Jillie. People started to depart the Sloane household at dinnertime. It was then that Gilbert realized he had forgotten to book a hotel in Iowa City.\r\n\r\nJillie’s mother noticed him lingering near the door of the house after most of the guests had left. He was waiting for an opportune moment to ask for the name of a hotel nearby.\r\n\r\n“Do you have somewhere to stay tonight, Gilbert?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Actually,” Gilbert said, “I forgot to book a hotel. I was going to ask you for a recommendation.”\r\n\r\n“Stay here tonight,” she said.\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t impose on you,” Gilbert said, “I’m sure I can find a room somewhere.”\r\n\r\n“No, really, Gilbert,” Jillie’s mom said, “You came all the way from New York. It would be no trouble.”\r\n\r\nThat night, Gilbert sat in bed and stared at the ceiling. Despite the travel and late hour, he was not tired. He thought of the conversation he had with Ritchie over breakfast before he left for Iowa City.\r\n\r\n“How could she have done it at Christmastime?” Gilbert had asked.\r\n\r\nRitchie shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Are you serious, Gilbert?”\r\n\r\nGilbert nodded.\r\n\r\n“Dude, people get down this time of year. There are more suicides between Thanksgiving and Christmas than any other month.”\r\n\r\n“Well that’s what the media claims,” Gilbert said, “But it doesn’t exactly make sense.”\r\n\r\n“Doesn’t make sense!? It’s a time of year when you’re forced to spend money and time with your family. If you’re having issues with either one, and who the hell isn’t, you feel like a loser.”\r\n\r\n“But the movies—” Gilbert began.\r\n\r\n“The movies!? They make it worse. Everything ends up perfectly in every single one of those movies. That’s not the way real life goes.”\r\n\r\nRitchie shook his head and motioned towards the bag at Gilbert’s side. It was packed so Gilbert could head west to Jillie’s funeral.\r\n\r\n“This is, man,” Ritchie said.\r\n\r\nGilbert got out of bed and went over to his suitcase. He fished out the blue notebook with the clouds.\r\n\r\nDownstairs, Jillie’s father was seated at the kitchen table.\r\n\r\n“Couldn’t sleep either?” he said as Gilbert sat down with him.\r\n\r\nGilbert shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Milk?” Jillie’s father asked.\r\n\r\nGilbert nodded. As Jillie’s father got up and poured two glasses Gilbert took the notebook out and placed it on the table in front of him.\r\n\r\n“What’s that?” her father said as he sat back down.\r\n\r\n“It was Jillie’s.”\r\n\r\n“A journal?”\r\n\r\n“Sort of.”\r\n\r\nJillie’s mother entered the kitchen.\r\n\r\n“I guess no one’s getting much rest tonight,” she said.\r\n\r\nShe sat down and took a sip out of Jillie’s father’s milk glass.\r\n\r\n“Gilbert was just telling us about this notebook,” Jillie’s father said.\r\n\r\nGilbert took the notebook in his hands.\r\n\r\n“About a year after she moved to the city Jillie and I had dinner one night. She started to cry halfway through. She was upset about the latest audition that hadn’t worked out. The next day I got this notebook for her.”\r\n\r\nGilbert opened the first page of the notebook. In the top right-hand corner there was a cutout picture of Santa Claus pasted in. Next to it was a few lines of Jillie’s handwriting.\r\n\r\nGilbert flipped through the book. Every page had a different Santa pasted into one corner along with Jillie’s handwriting.\r\n\r\n“I put these Santas in before I gave it to her,” Gilbert continued, “I told her to pretend that every day was Christmas. Because, really, why couldn’t it be? Putting everything else aside, it is just another day on the calendar, right? I told Jillie that when she was feeling down she should open the journal and write something she wanted for Christmas.”\r\n\r\n“She thanked me but she said she didn’t think writing that she wanted to be Julia Roberts would make it happen. I told her you never know.”\r\n\r\nGilbert paused to take a sip of milk.\r\n\r\n“A couple of months later I was at her place having dinner and she took the notebook out. I’d been wondering, ever since I gave it to her, if she was writing in it. She told me that the first few times she’d written that she wanted whatever role it was she was auditioning for that week. Then, when she hadn’t gotten them, she’d thrown the notebook into the drawer and not looked at it again for a bit.\r\n\r\n“But recently she’d started writing down other kinds of wishes. Small ones, like that the coffee shop on the corner would have chocolate croissants the day she went in. That she’d get a seat on the train to work. That the customer with the purple fedora who gives huge tips would sit in her section for lunch the next day. And some of those wishes came true.\r\n\r\n“After that night I’d ask her about the journal from time to time. Sometimes she would wave me off but other times she would say yeah, she was writing in it.”\r\n\r\nGilbert pushed the notebook across the table.\r\n\r\n“I thought maybe you’d like to see it.”\r\n\r\nJillie’s mother put a hand on her husband’s knee and then opened the journal with her other hand.\r\n\r\n“I wish there are no more than ten other blondes at the audition tomorrow,” she read. She smiled and turned to the next page.\r\n\r\n“I wish the Chinese delivery man doesn’t make me walk down all five flights of steps when he comes in ten minutes.”\r\n\r\nThe forecast had not called for snow. But a couple of hours later, as the first light of Christmas Eve Day filtered into the room, a light shower began outside. Jillie’s parents and Gilbert were still sitting at the table.\r\n\r\nJillie’s mom was on one of the last pages of the book.\r\n\r\n“I wish—” she began, and then she stopped. She looked at Gilbert.\r\n\r\n“This one’s about you.”\r\n\r\n“Go ahead,” Gilbert said.\r\n\r\n“I wish Gilbert—” she hesitated and looked at him again.\r\n\r\n“Are you sure?” she said.\r\n\r\nGilbert nodded.\r\n\r\n“I wish Gilbert would stop writing Christmas screenplays. I wish he’d stop creating characters that are never as good as he is. Gilbert’s my hero. I wish he knew that.”\r\n\r\nThe last entry in Jillie’s journal was written a week before she died. In it she wished that the Christmas season would go by as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nThe gravediggers were able to clear the snow with one scoop of the shovel before creating a space for Jillie’s casket. As it turned out the shower had only lasted an hour.\r\n\r\nThe graveyard was a half hour east of Jillie’s parents’ house. Gilbert decided to begin his drive home as soon as the burial was over.\r\n\r\nJillie’s parents walked him to his car.\r\n\r\n“You’re sure you don’t want to stay another night, Gilbert?” Jillie’s mom asked.\r\n\r\n“I really should be going,” Gilbert said.\r\n\r\nThe three of them stood at the door to his car.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry,” Gilbert said.\r\n\r\nFor the first time since everything had happened, Gilbert began to cry.\r\n\r\n“I—”\r\n\r\nGilbert didn’t finish.\r\n\r\nJillie’s mom reached over and hugged him.\r\n\r\n“You did, Gilbert,” she said.\r\n\r\nBy the time Gilbert reached Pittsburgh exhaustion from the drive and his lack of sleep the night before caught up to him. On the outskirts of town he pulled into the driveway of a one-story building.\r\n\r\nInside a middle-aged black woman sat at a desk. She was going through a file of papers.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me,” Gilbert said, “Would you happen to know where the closest hotel is?”\r\n\r\n“Five miles down the road on the right,” she said, “but if you help us with dinner, you can stay here for the night.”\r\n\r\n“What is the place?”\r\n\r\n“It’s a homeless shelter, sweetie.”\r\n\r\n“Well—”\r\n\r\n“It’d be a room in the volunteer ward. I know you’re not homeless.”\r\n\r\nGilbert paused.\r\n\r\n“You really want to be alone on Christmas?”\r\n\r\nDinner was baked ham, spinach casserole, rolls, and macaroni salad courtesy of a local restaurant. For dessert there was a large upside down cake.\r\n\r\nGilbert saw homeless people all the time in New York City but there was something different about this group on this night. He was curious about them. He wanted them to feel safe, tonight.\r\n\r\nHe filled a plate up with food when he was done serving. On one side of the dining room there was a table of volunteers but rather than sit with them Gilbert sat amongst the homeless. He waited for them to start talking to him. But once they did he engaged.\r\n\r\nLater on he helped the other volunteers with the dishes. The head volunteer, a man named Charlie, approached him.\r\n\r\n“You had a nice touch with the folks,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” Gilbert said. He dried a large bowl.\r\n\r\n“We have an opening for a fulltime staff member,” Charlie said, “I know you’re from out of town and all, but I thought I’d put it out there, seeing how well you did tonight.”\r\n\r\nOn Christmas morning Gilbert walked out to the rental car. He turned and took a long look at the shelter. It was much colder in Pittsburgh than in New York. There would be colder days ahead in the long Pittsburgh winter.\r\n\r\nYet later that day Gilbert would call the rental car company and tell them he would be returning the car in Pittsburgh rather than in New York. In a week’s time he would book a flight back to New York and, with Ritchie’s help, pack up his apartment. He would have dinner with Jillie’s parents after helping them go through her things. He would spend a day with his mother and Samuel. Then he would go into his life savings, buy a second-hand car, and drive it back to Pittsburgh. Once there he would get a private room at the shelter. He would spend his mornings helping in the kitchen and his afternoons serving meals.\r\n\r\nIn a little under a year’s time, when the shelter director moved on to work at a local home for battered women Gilbert would take over his position. A month after that he would meet a woman named Carolyn while, of all things, buying a Christmas tree for the shelter. Carolyn, a grade school teacher, half-Jewish, and obsessed with Humphrey Bogart movies, would later move in with Gilbert in the apartment he had begun to rent a few miles from the shelter. Gilbert would begin to write short stories based on the lives of people he met at the shelter. One would be published in a literary magazine put out by Carnegie Mellon. Carolyn would frame the first page of it and put it over their living room mantel.\r\n\r\nOn that Christmas Day the year Jillie died, though, Gilbert did not know what lay ahead. All he knew was that it was Christmas and he had no desire to see a Christmas movie. He wanted to see Jillie. But in the cold, early morning light, she was the only thing he could not see.', 'Liz Skillman lives in New York City, where she writes and teaches high school. Her short story “Rachel’s List” won first place in the 2007 Paul Gillette Writing Contest and in the same year was published in an anthology put out by the Aspiring Authors contest.

(24, 'The Ways You Are Gone', 'I wait for you, because I said I would. I spend the hours I used to spend with you thinking about the ways you are gone. The length varies, as does the content. Mostly you are dead and slowly becoming food for insects. This comforts me because when this is not you, you are frozen in pieces—arm, ear, breast, leg. Sometimes you are alive but kept, and the things I imagine are things I’ve seen in movies—so horrific they are funny. Chainsaws, machetes, meat hooks, underground dens of torture. I think of these things when I am missing you least.\r\n\r\nThe worst thought of all is that you are you. Alive. Lungs and legs strong from years of running, beautiful from years of believing so. I don’t tell anyone this, but it’s what I most fear—that you are safe. Happy. Beginning things.\r\n\r\nOn the ninth of every month, I travel to where you were last known. It isn’t far, nothing to be impressed by. I walk the trail they say you walked and listen to the trees and the wind and the twigs cricking under my feet. I take it in. There must be clues. When the creek is high, I imagine you shivering beside the trashing current. When the air is water before it touches skin, you rearrange the rocks and create a pool of coolness. When the trees are fat with leaves and shocking with color, you climb them and wait. You wait.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nBefore I leave this place each month, I look again at the ground and the tree trunks and try to find signs of struggle or a message carved into bark. I kneel and run my fingers over any divot or ripping away of moss as I’ve seen people do on crime television. I lay temple to ground, close my eyes and try to hear sounds of you—the thin snore of allergy season, the hiccups you get when I tickle you. I think hard about the relationship between you and the dirt and the trees and the condition of this place in the solid cold February when your feet last left their print. But it is just a wooded patch of land that does each season because it knows how to. There is nothing to interpret or understand. No broken nail, no earring, not even a hair, nothing but things that belong to the forest.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nOn the eighth month I decided it was time to forget you, not as the person you were, but as the one you were going to be, and let you just be a person gone. I kept the memory of the road you drove away from our life on, the bottle of vodka on the driver’s seat and the bag packed with two week’s worth of underwear. I kept the dents in the snow that led us nowhere. I kept the trees but not you in them, watching for me, waiting for me to figure it out, because there is nothing to figure. You were you. We were us. But now you are just something that happened.\r\n\r\nBy the next month you were again the woman I was waiting to marry. Because I couldn’t think of a reason not to, I put your wedding dress in the backseat of my car before I drove to the place. I knew it was dramatic—there was no reason for me to think the dress would make you come back, or that the dress should mean it was harder for me to lose you than anyone else, but it was dramatic that you were gone: television interviews, rewards, desperate pleas to the world, psychics in frumpy pant suits.\r\n\r\nWhen I got to the place there was family rooting for mushrooms. The children walked in slow stabs behind their father. When he knelt at the base of a tree, the children peeked over his shoulders while he carefully uncovered mushrooms from where I had knelt and crawled and slithered in search of even the tiniest piece of you. One child held a mushroom in his palms like a hairless kitten and giggled. I spread the picnic blanket over your dress and drove.\r\n\r\nAs I pulled into my driveway I decided to live our lives for the us. I’d age you, sicken you, get you over with. I gave our life one week.\r\n\r\nMonday: You are pregnant at twenty-three—younger than we’d planned. There is enough of a hint of twins in your family that I give us a boy and a girl. Everyone speaks of your “glow,” but by the sixth month you are almost too massive to move. I watch your stomach during the night, pillow between your knees, but the babies don’t move when you’re sleeping. You are swollen and transparent, but still pretty. You give birth, a C-section, and I am relieved about the parts of you that are spared.\r\n\r\nTuesday: We are in our thirties. You are trim but worn, like some weight would fill out the places that are wrinkling in. You sleep naked now, in your thirties it’s time to be comfortable with your own damn body, you say. I pull back the sheet and stare while you sleep. There is hair in new places. Violet veins tangle under your skin. You shiver and I cover you.\r\n\r\nWednesday: You are fifty-five. I’m fifty-seven. You are even thinner than at thirty-five, wrinkles too deep to see their beginning. Margaret and Jack live in other states so you travel to see them often while I keep the books for small businesses. We know we sleep with other people. It’s what we both expect the other to do. When I can get away, we travel to places like Greece, Italy, and Argentina. We always return in love, mostly.\r\n\r\nThursday: You are seventy-five. Margaret is dead, breast cancer. Jack is fine, but fat and unpleasant. We have grandchildren who seem to tolerate you and fear me. Your C-section scar halves you now that you’ve finally put on weight. I said you’d always be beautiful to me, but I just find you old and finished. Though we haven’t talked about it in years, on your birthday I make you tell me again about when you went missing. Your story is always the same—you needed time away to figure things out. You were only gone a little while. Don’t I remember?\r\n\r\nFriday: At eighty, I wake and the sheets are wet and I know you are dead. It had been a cold night, and I snuggled you lightly because you ached everywhere. Before you slept we both said, night, I love you. It should’ve meant something, but it was just what we always said before sleep. Your body finally looks soft. Not scary or sad or gross, just soft. It feels okay. Our life was fine.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nYour parents invited me to dinner on your birthday. And though I wanted to stay home and celebrate—somewhere you are twenty-one and I promised we’d drink until dawn, I put on a shirt your mother gave me for Christmas and was ten minutes early. The food was nice enough—turkey, slaw, dinner rolls with real butter, but I couldn’t stop thinking about how you would have never wanted this meal on your birthday and how the things of you were now things in a box. There were pictures, of course, what kind of parents wouldn’t have those, but nothing else. I know I shouldn’t judge or assume a damn thing about their grief, but people say no parent should ever have to lose a child and they were slowly packing you into boxes to stack in the garage.\r\n\r\nYou’d be mad to know it, you’d say it was cruel, but I asked them if they thought you were dead after your mother clanked a plate of pumpkin pie, which you hate, in front of me. She held the whipped cream over my slice, set it down and said, “Don’t you?” They looked at me, both with the last bit of hope smeared over their faces as if my answer would decide your fate. Your family was one of surfaces. Never any problems because nobody ever shared a damned thing, yet this was the deepest I’d ever been with them, maybe the deepest they’d ever been at all and I felt a little like God. I thought of sharing the elaborate ways I’d imagined you dead, the things you hated about your father and the things your father hated about your mother.\r\n\r\n“No,” I said. “I don’t.”\r\n\r\nAnd it was the truth. But so was the fact that I wished you were, or would hurry up and be something other than gone.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nI finished my pumpkin pie, said goodbye as though I planned to see them again, real soon, and they turned off the porch light before I got to my car. At first I thought it was rude, but decided they were just done and that felt good. I was tired of sharing despair with them.\r\n\r\nOn the walk to my car I wondered if telling the truth was ever the right thing to do. The psychic, Twila Omens, held item after item, books, sweaters, hats, gloves, shoes, even your toothbrush when your mother held it out to her and said “Please?” With some items she felt you. The feeling was electric, she said, and for a few seconds we all relaxed into our bodies thinking of the vital heat and color of electricity. But the feeling, she said, was retreating like a bright light dissolves behind the back of an eyelid.\r\n\r\nTwila had apologized as she gathered her overcoat and mittens.\r\n\r\n“I can’t imagine how hard it is for you,” she said, looking at me rather than your parents. “But I couldn’t just let you hope.”\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nWhen I got home I opened the wine we’d been saving for a time worth saving for. It was white, which I usually hate, but had tasted fine and sweet the day we’d slunk into the winery where we’d decided our ceremony would be, the dry Napa merlot and weather wringing out our energy. I baked chocolate chip cookies from a tube that popped when I twisted it. When the cookies were done I opened your gift I’d bought a couple of months earlier. I thought you would like it, but it was hard to say, because if you were alive you must be so different and if you were dead it would be so ridiculous. A miniature tea set, the saucers no bigger than a quarter, birds painted perched in tiny trees. I hated the clank of cup to saucer, though the size and detail was impressive. In the card I’d written, Happy 21st Birthday, Madeleine, because since you’d been gone I found it hard to think of you as a Maddy.\r\n\r\nThe expensive wine reminded me you went missing with a zero balance in our savings account. My money had gone to rent and the bills and fun, as arranged, as yours was to go into savings. That’s something I wouldn’t have known if you weren’t gone. There was money, you said, let’s get married, fly somewhere and stay. I’d imagined this sometimes before I slept. I figured we’d be happy wherever we went. We’d find work or live off the land, and though I had no idea how to survive like that, I pictured us being successful, being parents. And I guess I’d fall asleep and dream of these lives but something terrible would happen and I’d wake knowing I couldn’t just forget school, a career, family, friends. But there was no money. It was gone before you were. I never thought about it then, but now I wondered how I got tied up in so many things that weren’t you.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nTerra called me the day after your birthday. She sounded surprised when I answered.\r\n\r\n“We should get a drink or something, sometime,” she said after minutes of small and nothing talk.\r\n\r\nThough she’d said it the way people do when they assume both parties understand neither really means it, I said, “How about tonight?”\r\n\r\nI know she was just being kind to me because she was your best friend, but I showered, even though I already had, shaved, plucked between my eyebrows how you showed me, trimmed the hair on my chest and groin. We met at an Italian restaurant she suggested where you would’ve ordered a salad to avoid the carbohydrates. At dinner I laughed at her jokes because she wanted to think I was okay. She patted my hand. My nails were filed and smooth. I imagined sex with her as she decided on her meal. I imagined her lips in places yours hadn’t touched since our engagement. She decided on pasta, and though I am not violent, I imagined smashing my fists into her thighs, ass, ribs, just to feel the flesh of her.\r\n\r\nOn the drive home she talked about the last time she’d seen you as though it was new information. I wanted to say it was rude for her to talk about you on our date, but there was something on the road and I hit it.\r\n\r\nTerra looked out the back window and exhaled.\r\n\r\n“It’s okay. Just an opossum. Yuck. Such awful eyes.”\r\n\r\nI pulled over to make sure and she was right. It wasn’t dead. It quivered a bit, hissed, stilled. Its eyes were black holes against the snow.\r\n\r\nTerra stuck her head out the window and said she was freezing and needed to get home. I dropped her off and she hugged me hard.\r\n\r\n“Maddy’ll come back. I know it.”\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nAfter the date I snuggled with Margaret. Though your parents took everything in from your dorm room, they asked me to keep her. We’re dog people, they said. With you gone, Margaret loves me more than anything. I call her Mags, though you’d be crazy to hear it. When I first met her I asked you what kind of name Margaret was for a cat, but you needed to think it was a beautiful name, as it was to be your daughter’s, after your grandmother, so you gave it to something beautiful.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nI saw you alive a week after your birthday. You were in between a walk and a run as people are when they are in a hurry but don’t want to draw attention to themselves. Your hair was red and straight and long and you were wearing a flowing hippy skirt and a tank top, both were shades of your hair. When you finally looked at me I understood she wasn’t anything like you. She was older and heavier and more like a woman who had lived a lot more life than you. How long would I keep seeing bits of you in everyone else, in people I don’t know or that I hate, people you would hate that I saw you in? How long would it be before people would say You really should move on, and stop looking at me like I’ve buried or burned or chopped you into bits, though they all loved me before, loved us together, offered their services for our wedding, asked us how many kids we would have and when they could baby sit.\r\n\r\nBecause people asked about it, I often think of our last night together. There must have been something, people say, and they are right. There was something—normalcy. It was a weekend, so you were staying the night at my apartment. There was television, frozen pizza, a salad with blue cheese and walnuts, a shared bar of expensive chocolate after dinner. You went to bed first and were asleep when I joined you. You flopped away, moaned a little, and went back to sleep. I snuggled against you until there was sweat between us. You kissed me in the morning and said, I love you, Drive safely, It’s snowing, and you were gone.\r\n\r\nMaybe you told me you were leaving in a hundred ways that night. The way you flipped through the stations and the one you decided on. The red peppers you chopped and arranged next to the shriveled pepperoni. The way you slapped at the snooze button only once.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nI was surprised when Terra invited me to a BBQ for the loved ones of missing loved ones. I agreed to go because I figured it would look bad if I didn’t, but the more I thought about it the more I wanted to see what these people looked like. I wanted to know if they had lived their loved ones’ lives before killing them off then begging them back into life. Those sorts of thoughts must leave a smear like I see all over my face.\r\n\r\nThough Terra offered to pick me up I drove alone because I lied about having places to be later. It was a BBQ, so I brought plain potato chips because people would eat them even though nobody ever bought them. Multi-colored ribbons were tied around the fat trunk of an oak tree. Maybe you would’ve said it was pretty. There was a white banner stretched between two trees. It read: NOT UNTIL THEYRE HOME, each letter a color of the rainbow. Many people wore t-shirts with iron-on pictures of their missing.\r\n\r\n “Who’s your missing?” I turned to the hand on my shoulder and saw Marc.\r\n\r\nHe’d written his name in all caps on his nametag. The woman on his shirt was pretty even with the feathered hair and ruffled collar.\r\n\r\n“My fiancée, Madeleine. I don’t have a shirt.”\r\n\r\n“This is my fifth. Sarina’s been missing since ‘85. The faces wear out fast.”\r\n\r\n“Girlfriend?” I asked.\r\n\r\nMarc laughed. “Little sister. Good luck with your Madeleine.” He laughed again.\r\n\r\nPeople chatted as though familiar, but stood away from each other. I felt sorry for them and I felt better than them. I helped myself to a hamburger and chips.\r\n\r\n“Hello, Jack. I read about your Madeleine last winter. How are you?”\r\n\r\nI nodded, bit into the burger, and waited for lower case Denise to ask me if there were any new leads as people did when I saw them at the store or school.\r\n\r\n“Getting by,” I said.\r\n\r\nDenise wasn’t wearing her loved one. I guessed a missing daughter because her voice fluttered like your mother’s.\r\n\r\n“Get used to it. It doesn’t get any easier.”\r\n\r\nI wanted to say, Thanks, Denise, for your comforting words, but my “loved one” will come back, so fuck off. But what did I know?\r\n\r\nDenise joined a cluster of women. Though some of them were laughing, they all held themselves as if they were waiting for a gunshot.\r\n\r\nMarc found me again.\r\n\r\n“Found a burger, huh? Don’t mind Denise. She thinks she can say anything because hers was the worst. Alex was tortured. Her killer sent a letter with the details and photos but nothing about where the body is.”\r\n\r\n“So she’s not really missing anymore, I guess, huh?”\r\n\r\nMarc looked at me and shook his head. “They never come home.”\r\n\r\nMarc walked away like someone who really wants their words to resonate and though I hated his dramatic nature I felt a little better. During the first few months you were gone, everyone had words of comfort and advice—“You’re in my prayers,” “She’s a strong girl. Try not to worry,” “Don’t give up hope.” Words as thin as the air they were spoken into.\r\n\r\nI finished my burger and realized it was likely some of these people knew where their missing was. Maybe they were the ones that looked the most destroyed. I knew people suspected I had something to do with you. Why would a girl with everything pack a bag, cash her paycheck, drive into the middle of nowhere and disappear? Some nights I woke up sure they were right and that I’d simply blocked it out to protect myself. I saw you in my trunk, ashy arm pinned beneath the spare tire. I watched black and blue explode over your throat. Dreams are never literal, I told myself, though each time it took hours to convince myself it wasn’t me that made you gone.\r\n\r\nI used the bathroom and got into my car. I’d tell Terra later it was just too hard to be there, but I almost had to laugh at the scene. Ribbons and t-shirts to bring back the dead, or even more ridiculous, the missing who didn’t want to be found. How could I tell which one you were? I promised to wait for you, but how do you keep a promise to someone who isn’t anywhere?\r\n\r\nI stopped at the store for some beer. It was lit softly, nothing like the usual blaring glare. It was my first time in a real grocery store since you’d been gone. Of all the places we’d known together this was the one I imagined I would miss you most. You were everywhere. Life cereal. Red delicious. Double roll toilet paper you insisted on though it cost more. Pink razors, black beans, the red and yellow peppers I said we couldn’t afford. I’d avoided it because I feared the scene I might make by gathering all the things of you into a basket, dumping it over myself, holding the boxes and bags like they were the bits of you I loved most. Crying, of course, because people commented I hadn’t done much of it, yelling, blaming anyone who tried to console me because how could they ever have a fucking clue what I felt like?\r\n\r\nBut I didn’t make a scene. I bought beer and three cans of Fancy Feast for Mags, food you never would’ve let her eat, and made a joke about the combination to the checker.\r\n\r\nAt home, I slopped it onto a plate and set it on a foot stool so she wouldn’t have to strain her neck to eat. I’d read to do that somewhere. She looked at me, then at her all-natural-anti-hairball-weight-managing usual. I moved her close to the treat and pet her from head to tail.\r\n\r\n“Go ahead. It’s okay.”\r\n\r\nShe looked at me again and sniffed the food and I heard the flutter of a purr. She bit into the food with quick deep breaths, waiting to be shooed away. She ate until she heard the deep gut sobbing and looked at the mess of me. It was the most gone you’d ever been.\r\n\r\n“Sorry, Mags. Go ahead. Finish.”\r\n\r\nI slid my hand over her fur. She lifted her back into the pet, turned toward the food, sniffed, and took another bite.', 'Kami Westhoff\'s work has appeared in such journals as Meridian, River City, Phoebe, Third Coast, and various online publications.

(25, 'Agashi', 'Ken Krasner in a nutshell: He peers at me, bug-eyed, over the pages of his Newsweek and announces, “I have to go be a priest in Russia.” Me, skimming an in-flight magazine, all I can muster is a nod. When I look away it’s to gaze out the window at a cloudscape of pulled taffy suspended over the South China Sea. “Yeah,” he continues, “this says there’s no priests over there because there was no church for so long. So somebody’s got to do it.”\r\n\r\nI’m not suggesting Ken Krasner is the kind of guy who would give up everything and go be a priest in Russia. I’m only saying he’s the kind of guy who would talk about it. Why would he talk about it? We’re talking animals, I guess. We talk and talk and that’s supposed to equal what we are. Some of us just say stupider things, that’s all. “Just wait till we finish this crusade,” I say. “Then if you want to do Russia, you’re on your own.” After only an hour in the air, the plane is already descending. The green hills of Korea appear through a haze that might be Asian mystique and might be acute pollution.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nI have no good reason for settling in Hong Kong. I’d been doing an article about post-handover filmmaking, ran out of money and ended up teaching English at a private institute. The salary is fat and under the table and requires no valid papers, and I suspect the place is a front for organized crime. My students are Chinese captains of industry and government wonks who all want to learn about Paris Hilton. As long as I play down my Irish brogue and talk through my nose like an American, they’re happy. I’m less a teacher than an entertainer. My boss, Mr. Lim, makes sure I understand that. “The client must always be happy,” he says. That’s what he’s gleaned from Western-style capitalism. Never mind whether anybody ever learns anything. Not that I’m on some kind of crusade. I’m here for the money, buying time to finish my article. Mr. Lim supposedly has a phone number where Chow Yun-Fat can be reached. Chow Yun-fat? Asia’s biggest gun-toting screen star. Bruce Willis to one billion people. My ticket to international publication and, possibly more edifying, an apartment of my own. Mr. Lim played that for all it was worth. “I should like to make a conversation,” he announced. “You and Mr. Ken please come see me after lunch.”\r\n\r\nHere it was: Lim wanted me and Krasner to take a vacation. South Korea was beautiful this time of year, and Lim was worried about our legal status. By leaving Hong Kong and then returning, we could get real work visas and the Institute could go legit. And there was this one other thing: he wanted us to find his niece in Pusan and bring her back with us. He wasn’t sure exactly where she was, but he was sure she would rather be in Hong Kong with him than in Korea where she was an orphan. For this service, Lim would bankroll our trip and hand us a bonus on our return. Plus, he said, he could get me Chow Yun-fat’s phone number, no problem.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nThat’s how we ended up on a Cathay Pacific flight to South Korea, me and Krasner, side by side in Business Class. I can’t say for sure why Krasner is doing it, but I have my reasons. Without money, papers, or Chow Yun-fat, I’m a wetback in China with nowhere to go but back to Ireland. If you’ve ever been penniless in Dublin, you’ll know that’s not an attractive option. But Krasner, who knows what he’s thinking?\r\n\r\n“Lim’s niece,” I say as the stewardesses moves up the aisle collecting plastic cups and trash. “Do you suppose that goes with quotation marks? ‘Niece?’”\r\n\r\n“Hmmm?”\r\n\r\nI have to spell it out for him. “The niece thing. What’s up with that? Why can’t he get one of his shady associates to do it for him?”\r\n\r\n“We are his shady associates. Anyway, she may be in trouble.”\r\n\r\nEverything, you see, is a crusade for Ken Krasner.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nI have a difficult time being around Krasner for very long. That’s because I’m literally within ten feet of the yankee son of a bitch every day, all day long, week in and week out. We both teach English at Lim’s Institute in Kowloon, and share a desk in the teacher’s office. By sharing a desk I mean that it’s one desk, designed for a Chinese-sized person, and our two chairs sit side by side and our piles of books overlap and our coffee cups clink all day long. Our schedule is the same, and we ride the bus home together. We share a tiny apartment, courtesy of Mr. Lim. Our separate bedrooms open onto a living room with tile floors and no furniture save for a bunch of throw pillows that I use to sit by the window, and the folding chair where Krasner watches TV and reads his Newsweeks. All week long, Krasner and me, side by side. For weeks at a time he’s the only person besides my students that I talk to. I tried to make our relationship a good one but my efforts petered out quickly. Krasner is a chain-smoking, Coke-guzzling, Pringles-smacking, Newsweek-addled Anti-Christ. Worse, he has come to represent all Americans to me: insecure, ultra-organized, wracked with guilt. If I could push a button and erase him from existence, then push push push, I would I would I would.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nFrom the air, Pusan looks like a ruined urban wasteland, and that’s what it looks like from the ground too except that you can smell it. Even if Korea really was nice this time of year, you would never know it because the place is nothing but concrete high-rises, clogged avenues and low-hanging pollution. The taxi ride from the airport, while not particularly far, takes a good two hours. We arrive at Haeundae Beach, where Lim had booked us a double room in the Hyatt Regency. I stand in the tenth floor window and look out over the bay where a hazy line may be the coast of Japan or may be the fumes rising from an oil slick. Ships criss-cross the horizon. All along the curve of the bay stand high-rises covered in the geometric syllables of Korean, advertising who-knows-what. Dozens of umbrellas and tents cluster along the concrete boardwalk where the indistinct forms of Koreans come and go in the falling twilight.\r\n\r\nKrasner takes an hour to unpack. He’s brought two suitcases for our weeklong sojourn. I watch him taking his silverware out of a plastic bag and lining the utensils up on the coffee table. “Can’t do chopsticks,” he says when he sees me watching him. He changes into mismatched trousers and a sport coat with a knit tie, and combs his stringy hair across the top of his head. Me, I thought vacations were about not having to put on a tie. I’m in a tee shirt and jeans. I throw my book bag, the only thing I brought, on the bed by the window to stake my claim and I’m ready. Krasner has the address. We go down for a taxi.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nThe niece’s name is Soon-hee. The address is a coffee shop in an outlying suburb and the taxi takes an hour to get there. We pass along a freeway that seems to leave the city, cutting through a valley of pine-covered hills and then we fly around a bend and enter another teeming urban knot. The driver doesn’t know the place we’re looking for, only the district, and so we clamber out and pay on some random street where neon signs hang overhead and workers scrub fish guts off the pavement in front of a closing market.\r\n\r\nComing from Hong Kong, the sight of a thousand neon signs masking every facade is not unsettling, but here I can’t decode anything. There is the occasional English motto, like “Drink and Friend,” or “Lucky Time!” but there’s no telling what these places are. All the buildings are variations on the same theme of slapdash brutalist architecture, covered in bathroom tile or aluminum panels with tinted windows. The place we’re looking for is the “Earthangel Coffeeshop” but there’s no telling if the sign will be in English. None of the streets have names and there are no numbers over the doorways.\r\n\r\nIt’s been a day of nothing but taxis and planes and waiting in traffic. My head is throbbing. Krasner stands next to me sucking on a Marlboro and the sour smoke wafts around my head. “Maybe we should try tomorrow,” I say. I’m thinking about the dark and mellow pub I spied in the lobby of the Hyatt when we checked in. But Krasner is energized. “We have a job to do,” he states. That’s Krasner for you. Last week he spent all day cutting photos out of magazines to make flashcards of things like KEY and PHONE and PEN. He cut out the pictures, scanned them into the computer, then printed them and taped them to index cards. Then he painstakingly typed and printed the words on the back side and had them laminated at a copy store. All this for one lesson. When I get to that unit, I grab a key, a phone and a pen from the office and take everything to class. Total prep time: one minute. It might mean that Ken Krasner’s a highly dedicated teacher, totally committed to the best possible lesson he can give, or it might just mean that he’s an idiot. And does it mean that I’m a lazy slob? Or a brilliant improvisationist? I ponder these questions all the time.\r\n\r\nHere’s his current idea. He wants to find a Korean/English dictionary and look up the symbols for ‘coffee shop.’ Then we can scan the signs all along the streets, eliminating everything but the potential coffee shops and thus, by investigating every one of them, come to our destination. To this end, he begins to look for a bookstore. I take the address from him, written in neat print in his agenda book, and walk into a corner store. I approach the clerk and hold out the book, pointing to the address. The clerk stares at me, astonished, not even looking at the book. “Here,” I say, pointing at the address. “Where? Do you know where?”\r\n\r\nSeveral customers in the place stop to stare as well. It occurs to me that maybe no Westerner has ever set foot in this store before, or in this neighborhood for that matter. Certainly no blue-eyed, redheaded freckle-face like me. Finally the clerk glances at the address but shakes his head fiercely. “Anyo, anyo,” he’s saying, waving his hands. Whatever it is I could possibly need, he’s sure he can’t help me.\r\n\r\nOutside I spot a cop standing in an intersection as cars flash past but he doesn’t seem to be directing traffic. I walk out to him while Krasner stands watching from the curb. The cop, seeing me approach, visibly tenses. He stares as I show him the address. Shakes his head, mumbling something. Krasner begins shouting and gesticulating. That’s when I see, following Krasner’s waving arm, a neon design of a cartoon girl with a halo and angel wings hanging in a second-story window. I abandon the cop and Krasner and I walk along the front of the building searching for a doorway that might lead upstairs. It takes us another five minutes before we spot a guy coming out a door marked only in Korean. We go in and up the steps to enter a dimly lighted lounge lined with vinyl booths and overgrown with plastic potted plants. Incense hangs in the air.\r\n\r\n“Have you thought about what we’re going to tell her?” I say as we take a booth.\r\n\r\nWith a twinkle in his eye, Krasner pulls something out of his inner jacket pocket and puts it on the table. It’s a Hong Kong passport. I open it and find the photo of a girl on the first page. By ‘girl’ I mean Not A Woman. She’s a child, eyes wide in the camera flash, hair cropped in the cut that signifies ‘middle school girl’ everywhere in Asia. I scan the info, find the birth date. She’s fourteen. “That’s her,” says Krasner.\r\n\r\n“Lim gave you this?”\r\n\r\n“Yep.”\r\n\r\n“Is it real? Is it a valid passport?”\r\n\r\n“Who knows? He said it’ll work.”\r\n\r\nI push it back across the table. Shifty Mr. Lim. What’s he doing with an ‘orphan niece’ working in some shady coffee shop in South Korea? What are we doing here looking for her? And moreover, why did Lim trust Krasner with the passport and not me?\r\n\r\nA waitress arrives. She brings no menu but instead slides into the booth next to me, smiling radiant. Her eyelids are painted silver, her lips peachy and wet. She chatters something in Korean, and we just smile. “Coffee?” I say. She giggles behind her hand, shaking her head. A moment passes as we look at each other. “English?” says Krasner. She bounds up and returns a moment later with another girl and they both sit down with us, smiling.\r\n\r\nI notice, around the room, several other tables where men sit side by side with young girls. There appear to be no conversations happening anywhere. The silver-eyelids-girl next to me pushes a strand of my hair behind my ear. Her hand comes to rest on my leg and I say to Krasner, “This is a hostess bar.”\r\n\r\n“I think so,” he says.\r\n\r\nWhen they bring drinks, they bring one for each of us. My waitress stirs sugar into my coffee spoonful by spoonful until I stop her. Then she picks up the cup and offers it to me. “Show them the picture,” I say as I take a sip.\r\n\r\nKrasner opens the passport and shows it to both of them. “Soon-hee?” he says. They take turns scrutinizing the picture but shrug their shoulders. I tap the table, wave around the room. “Where’s Soon-hee? Where’s Soon-hee?” Nothing. The girls stare.\r\n\r\nKrasner pulls out his smokes, offers them around and he and the girls light up. I watch the streetscape out the tinted windows, the comings and goings of pedestrians moving through the crawling traffic, the steam rising from sewer grates, the cop who remains standing in the intersection doing nothing. At least for a moment it feels like I really am on vacation: a strange place, a comfortable room, a drink, some kind of intrigue with these waitresses or whatever they are. The feeling of not knowing what might happen next, where this day will come to an end. I feel the girl’s hand on my knee again and I say to Krasner, “Why don’t we just call it quits and take one of these girls back? I doubt Lim would mind.”\r\n\r\nBut Krasner doesn’t see the humor in this. He watches me, bewildered, then springs up and crosses the room to where an old woman is tending a cash register. We all watch as he shows the passport to the woman. Their exchange goes on for some time and then the woman writes something on a napkin. Krasner peels a bill out of his wallet and slides it across the counter. He returns, triumphant. “Ah!” he says, sitting down. He puts his arm around the girl next to him and throws back a slug of coffee. Then he waits for me to ask him what happened.\r\n\r\n“Used to work here, I guess,” he says. “From what I could tell. She gave me a map to another place where she might be now.” He slides the napkin map across the table for me to inspect. It’s a bunch of criss-crossing lines in isolated patches with Korean scribbles here and there.\r\n\r\n“She used to work here?” I say, fixing him with my eye. “Doing what?”\r\n\r\nKrasner shrugs. He takes his arm back from the girl, arranges the map and passport in his agenda again. “She was an agashi.”\r\n\r\n“Agashi?”\r\n\r\n“Yeah. A ‘young lady.’ That’s what she said, in a little bit of English.” Krasner eyes me as if meeting a challenge.\r\n\r\n“In other words, more than a waitress.”\r\n\r\nBut he pretends not to hear that. We pay what seems like a very steep bill and go back onto the street. The waitresses follow us down the steps. They wave and beam. “Goodbye, goodbye,” we say, wandering into the street to find a taxi.\r\n\r\n“She’s no niece,” I say as we ride the freeway back through the hills. Krasner is staring out the window. “She may be an orphan, and she may have been Lim’s agashi, but she’s no niece.”\r\n\r\nKrasner sighs. “I don’t know,” he says. “I don’t know.”\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nThe taxi driver follows our napkin map back to Haeundae Beach where our high-rise hotel looms glittering in the beams of spotlights. But we pass the hotel and turn down a side street, away from the beach and around the back, entering a small district of cheap bungalows built from cinderblock and aluminum siding. Each house has a large window facing the street and in each window sits a woman on a chair by a lamp. They look out at the street, watching us pass. We come to a stop. The driver is saying something but it means nothing and we pay and get out. Overhead rises the back side of the Hyatt, windows lighted here and there, figures moving in their airtight luxury rooms. We’re standing in front of a bungalow where the woman in the window watches us with hooded eyes, fanning herself with a magazine. She’s wearing a bathrobe that sort of looks like a kimono with her hair up off her neck and pinned with chopsticks. Sweat stands out on her forehead. Finally, as if she had been hoping we would just go away, she beckons to us with the magazine. At last she smiles.\r\n\r\nWe have no way of knowing if this is the place or if the driver just dropped us off in front of some random house. At the corner a group of men in suits walks through a pool of streetlight, speaking in the familiar sing-song of Cantonese. They head for the main street and walk toward the Hyatt. Other male voices can be heard elsewhere in the streets and different layers of music peel softly from the houses.\r\n\r\n“I think I know where this is going,” I say. “Do we need to go through with this?”\r\n\r\n“We have to find her,” says Krasner.\r\n\r\nIs it possible that in order to get an interview with a Hong Kong movie star I have to hunt down a teen whore in South Korea and bring her back to China? Is that reasonable? Would anyone else in their right mind go through with this?\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nThe woman in the window meets us at the door of the house. She looks at the passport photo but shows no reaction. She hands it back and walks down a hallway into a lighted room, waving us to follow. Krasner and I go after her. In the room are four girls sitting on couches and watching TV. They look at us without much curiosity. A conversation ensues during which I think I hear the name ‘Soon-hee’ surface a couple times. Krasner, I notice, is becoming nervous. He slicks the hair across the top of his head and straightens his tie and buttons his suit coat, then unbuttons it again. Finally two of the girls get up and take us each by the arm, leading us down another hall where they try to take us into separate rooms. Krasner pulls back. “Wait wait wait,” he’s saying to the girl. “What’s going on?”\r\n\r\nShe stares.\r\n\r\n“Krasner,” I say, “I think you know what’s going on. The question is, how far will it go?”\r\n\r\nHe looks at me bug-eyed. He should have just gone straight to Russia to be a priest. “She’s not here,” he says, breathless.\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t think so.”\r\n\r\nHe goes back down the hall, through the lighted room and out the front door. I follow him into the street where the woman in the window watches us through the fanning of her magazine. He stands there on the gravel in the streetlight, looking around. “This is bad,” he says.\r\n\r\nI head back for the hotel. He catches up in a minute. “Where are you going?” he wants to know.\r\n\r\n“This is ridiculous,” I say. “We’re not going to find her in a city of prostitutes. I’m on vacation. I’m going for a drink.”\r\n\r\n“What about the girl?”\r\n\r\n“She’s in one of those bordellos, obviously. If you want to hunt through each of them, be my guest. I’m taking the night off.”\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nLater, in our tenth floor room at the Hyatt, I’m sitting in an overstuffed chair by the sealed window looking out over the harbor. The lights of fishing boats bob on the waves and cars flash past along the boardwalk. Krasner came back with me, paced around for a few minutes then declared he was going down to the pub in the lobby to see if he could find an American to talk to. Me being Irish I could give him no comfort. In fact, I had been planning on hitting the pub myself but I revised my schemes for the evening and instead called room service, courtesy of Mr. Lim. So here I am with a glass of Pernod and a plate of steamed mussels in garlic with chips and I couldn’t be better.\r\n\r\nWatching my reflection in the window I see someone else. The image floats like a ghost over the lights of the harbor. It’s Chow Yun-fat, blowing in on the Trade Winds. From out of the night he strides through the glass and into the room. Black suit, black shirt, thin black tie, dark shades. He paces about, peering at the plate of mussel shells and my empty glass of Pernod but he doesn’t seem to see anything. He’s thinking in a silent movie kind of way, knotted eyebrows, flexing jaw, then a sudden look out the window where it seems he finds the answer to whatever has been vexing him.\r\n\r\nHe’s out the door with a loping stride. Riding the elevator down with his head raised in a light rain of Muzak, chewing his lip. Cut to hotel exterior, Chow dashing across the circle drive, cutting through the landscaping hedges and disappearing into the darkness.\r\n\r\nNow he strides down the center of a dusty road through pools of streetlight, scanning the facades of the bungalows where women sit in their robes watching him pass. Perhaps he gives one of them a smile. At last he stops in the middle of the road. A close up reveals the way he shakes a cigarette out of a pack, grasps it with thin lips, crumples the empty pack and throws it away. The lighter flame hovers in both lenses of his shades and casts his face in the copper of a death mask. He strides out of the frame.\r\n\r\nInside the house we see him approach from the point of view of the woman in the window. He pulls the door open and walks down the hall as if it is his own house and he intends to punish the children. Now he enters a lighted room where four young girls in gauzy dresses recline watching TV. They scarcely have a chance to look up at him before he crosses his arms at the waist and pulls two black .45s from his belt, sweeping them in an arc across the room where he fires round after round into the wall behind the couch. The girls cringe and scream. He kicks in a door to find a man kneeling on the floor with his pants down, rooting in the pockets of a discarded coat. On the bed in the background is the astonished oval of the girl’s face: the girl from the passport picture. She holds the sheets against her body, sobbing. Chow levels the gun at the kneeling man and pulls the trigger but there is only a dry click. He dives away at just the moment that the kneeling man gets off a shot from a gun hidden in the folds of the coat. The bullet pierces Chow’s arm and he tumbles into the hallway in slow motion, landing on his wound, teeth clenched. Bullets fly from down the hallway. He raises his other gun, mutters, “One bullet,” and shoots the man between the eyes.\r\n\r\nAll is ringing silence. Then the sobs of the women. Chow strides into the bedroom, blood dripping from his arm, and stands before the girl. Carrying her wrapped up in her bloodied sheet he walks through the house, stepping over the bodies of his victims, and carries her outside. Her arms go around his neck and, as they pass from a pool of light into darkness, he can be seen to stumble before catching his stride and disappearing into the night.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nI stroll around the harbor in the afternoon. The concrete boardwalk is lined with the tarps and tents of booze-and-seafood joints and I’m cruising them to find one that looks less choleric than the others when I hear Krasner’s voice. He’s talking in that ridiculous pidgin English he uses when speaking with a student. “You like dress?” he’s saying. “Dress? You like?”\r\n\r\nI peer around the corner of a tarp and there he is sitting at a plastic table with a girl, two beers and a steaming platter between them. He sees me and leaps up, booming, “Hey! We’ve got her! We’ve got her! She’s the one!” He waves me over, pulling a bunch of shopping bags off a plastic chair.\r\n\r\nI take a seat and look at the girl. My first thought is, No way, it’s not her, this girl looks twenty at least. She’s wearing silver eyeliner and silver lipstick and her hair is cut in a fireworks pixie sort of ‘do, dyed orange. She sits erect in a sleeveless silk blouse and her shoulders are broad and she looks strong and healthy and built. She stares at me a moment then looks away out at the beach and the grey tide.\r\n\r\nKrasner hands me the passport. I glance at the picture again and it’s true. The picture might have been taken a couple years ago, but it’s the same face. I hand the passport back. “So this I’ve gotta hear, Krasner. Did you go in with guns blazing? How did you find her?”\r\n\r\nHe beams at me, silent. I refuse to play his damn game. I inspect the dish they’re eating, some concoction of miniature octopi in a stewy sauce. I grab a couple chopsticks (Krasner, I see, has brought his fork and spoon with him) and try a bite. Spicy. Chewy. Curious.\r\n\r\n“You want to know?” says Krasner.\r\n\r\n“Yeah, sure, I want to know. Whenever you’re ready.”\r\n\r\n“I bought her.”\r\n\r\nI look at him. He’s still beaming. Waiting for me to ask him what the hell he’s talking about. “What the hell are you talking about, Krasner?”\r\n\r\n“Yeah, I bought her. Half a million won. It’s not that much, really. Less than five hundred bucks.”\r\n\r\n“You walked into that bordello with half a million won and you bought this girl?” She’s watching all of this, understanding nothing but getting that we’re talking about her.\r\n\r\n“Well, pretty much. The thing is, they want me to bring her back at the end of the weekend. I think that was the deal. The old woman there spoke English. She must have learned it from the G.I.s. She kept calling me ‘Sarge.’”\r\n\r\n“And what happens when you don’t bring her back, Sarge?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing. They have my credit card but all I have to do is cancel it. They’re not expecting anyone to run away with one of the agashis anyway.”\r\n\r\n“Young lady,” I say, looking at the girl.\r\n\r\n“Niece, actually. Turns out agashi really means niece. It’s for unmarried women, sort of like ‘miss.’” Krasner pulls open one of his plastic bags. Inside is a dog-eared Hang-gul/English dictionary.\r\n\r\n“This is crazy, Krasner. What does she have to say about all this?”\r\n\r\nWe both look at her and she immediately blushes. “Soon-hee,” Krasner says and reaches for her hand but she pulls it away. He looks at me. “We went shopping today. I bought her a bunch of clothes and makeup and shoes and pizza. She can’t get enough of it. I think no one’s ever taken care of this girl in her whole life.”\r\n\r\n“Lim didn’t say anything about taking the girl out shopping, Krasner. Is that going on the expense account? You want him to get jealous?” But as soon as I say it I know what’s coming next. This is his moment. His eyes get all dark, his bottom lip juts out and he raises his head. “It doesn’t matter what Lim thinks. She’s not going back to him.”\r\n\r\nI stare out at the horizon which is no horizon at all but just an inky wash between the grey of the sea and the grey of the sky. Ships slide through the haze. A dirty foam washes on the shore and the sound is as muffled as the colors. I’m imagining the possible directions this can now take, and which one will end up with me not sleeping with the fishes in Victoria Harbor. “You’re talking dangerous now, Krasner. Let’s get on the plane, take the girl to Lim and you can fight your crusade on home turf, yeah?”\r\n\r\nHe takes a slug of beer, shakes his head, thumps the bottle back down. “Nope. You can go back whenever you want. I’m not going back.”\r\n\r\n“Oh for fuck sake.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not in the business of buying girls for Chinese mob bosses.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you just bought one.”\r\n\r\n“Not for Lim. And this is where it ends.”\r\n\r\nI look at the girl. She’s toying with a baby octopus, pushing it around in the sauce with her chopsticks. She hasn’t touched her beer and so I reach for it, take a gulp, set it back down in front of her. “What do you think about all this?” I say to her. She watches me wide-eyed. I pick up the passport, show her the cover that says Hong Kong in Chinese characters. “Do you want to go to Hong Kong?” I make a flying plane with my hand, heading out over the ocean with a whooshing sound. She just watches me. “Hong Kong,” I say. “Discos.” I wiggle a little dance in my seat. “And movies. Do you want to meet a movie star? Chow Yun-fat?”\r\n\r\nShe seems to show some recognition. I say the name again and make shooting noises, gunning with both index fingers, pumping Krasner full of bullets. But maybe that was the wrong thing to do. She gets cloudy again and then says a whole string of things which leaves me and Krasner blinking. Her voice is small and delicate, like a little girl’s. She ends up laughing. Then she reaches for a shopping bag and pulls out a long black dress emblazoned with a plastic silver star in the chest. “Disco,” she says.\r\n\r\nI turn to Krasner. “I think she wants to go to Hong Kong, Sarge.”\r\n\r\n“Just because she said ‘disco?’ There’s discos everywhere. Look at her. She doesn’t belong in Hong Kong any more than you or I do.”\r\n\r\n“Bad analogy, Krasner, because I in fact do belong in Hong Kong, and that’s where I’m going as soon as I can get a plane out of here. If you’re not coming—or, more to the point, if the girl’s not coming—then you’d better have a good story ready because Lim will be looking for you. And I’m not covering your damn arse.”\r\n\r\nKrasner sits like a stone. He’s looking at the girl, and she’s looking at him. They stare at each other and, despite the oceans that separate their lives and their illusions, they’re locked together. A leading man, and his leading lady. I rise from the table and step back. How would Chow Yun-fat handle this one? Shoot everybody? But even Chow may be no match for Krasner. I have to admit, Chow probably never would have thought about walking into that bordello with a credit card and a dictionary. An uneasy feeling creeps up on me: Is Krasner actually the hero here? Conflicted but unwavering, he beats the odds…and gets the girl. And what does that make me—the craven sidekick who takes a bullet between the eyes at the end of act one?\r\n\r\nI walk back to the hotel. At the front desk is a message from Lim. He wants to know how things are going. I ask the clerk to relay the message that we’re still looking, no luck yet. Then I go up to the room and lie down in front of the TV with some action movie blaring, falling asleep on the couch to the squeal of tires and the pounding of guns.\r\n\r\nIt’s dark when Krasner lets himself into the room. I stir and watch him as he collects his suitcases and then stands framed in the light from the hallway. The girl stands out there with Krasner’s wool blazer enveloping her body, shopping bags in each hand. She stares at me, expressionless. “Tell Lim we couldn’t find her,” Krasner says. “Tell him I’m still looking and I’ll be in touch. Tell him whatever you want, actually.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell him you rode off into the sunset,” I say. I can’t help admiring the goddamn jackass, but he just snorts at me and goes out the door with his bags.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nLim sits tenting his fingers together over his desk, trying to see through me. I’m watching the skyline out the window behind him where ferries move across Victoria Harbor toward the glittering towers downtown. A lot of this conversation has passed in silence so far. Lim’s Rolodex stands on the desk between us, containing Chow Yun-fat’s phone number somewhere within. Now Lim says, “You permitted him to kidnap the girl.”\r\n\r\n“No,” I say. “I tried to talk to him. But you know how Americans are. They want to save the world.”\r\n\r\n“You permitted it.”\r\n\r\n“I think he might have been in love with her, sir. He had that look.”\r\n\r\nLim nods slowly, staring into the desktop. “Yes,” he says quietly, “yes.”\r\n\r\n“And there’s no negotiating with that.”\r\n\r\nHe looks at me, steely. “I should not have sent the two of you. You were wrong. Westerners do not understand loyalty. You are weak, aren’t you? You only think of yourselves.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry, Mr. Lim.” I suppose he was right about me, but he was off the mark about Krasner.\r\n\r\n“I am right. It was a mistake. I will handle this now.”\r\n\r\n“Okay.”\r\n\r\n“You have lost your friend.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“That is a pity.”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Perhaps,” I say, “Chow Yun-fat would have known what to do.”\r\n\r\nLim raises his eyebrows. He leans forward on his elbows. “It’s too bad, then, that you will never speak with him.” He spins the Rolodex closed with a flick of his finger, and Chow Yun-fat is lost to me. But I’m thinking that Chow is yesterday’s news. It would be a whole lot more interesting to talk to Krasner now and find out just how far he was planning on taking this whole thing. Tracking him down might turn out to be even harder than getting an interview with a Hong Kong action star, but maybe he could use my help, and I certainly don’t have anything better to do.', 'AC Koch lived in Pusan, South Korea, in the mid-90’s, where he learned the awesome power of kimchi.

(26, 'Summit', 'Every time I walk through this Summit train station, the first thing that hits me is the vinegar stench of piss from the men’s room, mixed with the sweet and salt of that crumbling chop suey stand across the street. I clear out in a hurry and hit the Quick Stop Shop for some beer on the way over to Ma’s. Ma lives in the middle of everything: right on West 58th, just off 55, south of Chicago-proper.\r\n\r\nI came back last year to take care of her, and she’s giving me a place to stay till I get back on my feet. Over fifty years ago, her doctor said, “don’t have any kids.” She almost died, breaking his rules and smuggling me into the world. Ma considers me a gift.\r\n\r\nIt’s getting late in the afternoon, my head hurts, my back aches, and I need a cigarette. It’s a mile stretch here and back to Ma’s apartment, and for a fifty-five-year-old with forty-five years of smoke in his lungs, I’m beat.\r\n\r\nIt’s been hot four days in a row, and the heat and whatever else it is I’m breathing gives me a sick, crappy feeling. The oily asphalt, the reek from the Arco Corn Products plant across the highway, the car fumes, and everybody’s sweat whips Summit up into a giant cocktail of urban stink.\r\n\r\nAt Ma’s apartment, I set my bag down and open a can of beer. She’s sitting with her friend Loretta in the kitchen, which is pretty much just a sink, a stove, and a folding card table. When the greetings are out of the way, me, Ma, and Loretta, who lives just upstairs, deal a three-way round of Uno and shoot the shit.\r\n\r\nMa’s little window air conditioner is just barely spitting cool, a real let down for anyone who’s spent time outside. Inside, the apartment doesn’t smell much better than the train station, with Ma’s Ben-gay lotion rubbed in the sweaty folds of her skin, old coffee on the burner too long, and Roach-Pruf dusted on everything.\r\n\r\nLoretta looks like a polish sausage in polyester, with big yellow hair and wet, oily makeup. She’s gross, yeah, but I still like her. At least, I like her stories. Ma does, too. Loretta always has one about some tramp or drunk that barges into Hot Shoppes, where she waits on tables. I like to watch Ma listen. She takes a second to think over what Loretta says, and then she’s snorting and cracking up, with that loose skin of hers shaking all over from the days when Ma used to be fatter than two Lorettas put together.\r\n\r\nLoretta goes on about the Indian guy upstairs. Shalzar, or Shazhad—something like that. We call him ‘Shazam’ to make it easy. Loretta says she saw him in some kind of voodoo trance or something.\r\n\r\n“You couldn’t miss it, Sylvia!” Loretta says to Ma, opening her eyes up wide, “His drapes were wide open! He smokes crack or something.” She says this like she’s sure of it, rambling on about how India is a big drug place.\r\n\r\n“When the Beatles went there, that’s when they started getting weird. They don’t talk about India much on TV,” she says, “for good public relations.”\r\n\r\nPersonally, I could give a shit about India, or the Beatles, or the guy upstairs. I guess all that shows on my face when I tell Ma and Loretta they’re just a pair of dumb old clacks who wouldn’t know India if it bit them on the ass.\r\n\r\n “What’s your problem, Frankie?” hollers Ma, looking over at me red-cheeked and mad, like her blood pressure just zoomed through her head.\r\n\r\nI ignore her the way I always do when she makes an ignorant remark. Ma needs to realize that I’m the one who went to high school, I’m the one who got out of Summit, and I’m definitely the only one in this goddamned town—maybe in the whole goddamned Chicagoland area—who knows how the world really works. Besides, she knows I hate it when she calls me “Frankie.” Ma seems to forget these facts fairly often.\r\n\r\nShe pats me on the hand and tries again, in a calmer voice, “I’m glad you’re back, Frank. Just your being here is good enough. It’s good enough for me, Frankie.”\r\n\r\nAfter a second I ask, “Got any cigarettes, Ma?” This is how we make up.\r\n\r\nMa hands me a white carton of those generic cigarettes she saves up for when I need them, which is just about all the time. She keeps them stuffed in a big cardboard box under her hospital bed, next to the kitchen table. I peel open a pack, and grab at the inside of my jacket for matches.\r\n\r\n“Jesus, Frankie!” Ma explodes again, “Don’t smoke in here! I told you a million times, Doctor Goldberg says I can’t take it no more!”\r\n\r\nWhat that idiot doctor really says is that Ma can’t take me no more. Outside her hospital room last month I heard him say it. And Ma has the nerve to say back to the doctor that she has to hang on, so that she can take care of me. I’m a grown man, for Chrissake! It’s goddamned embarrassing.\r\n\r\nI take myself outside to smoke my cigarette under the concrete steps to the upstairs. Rusted-out iron and railings hold up the steps, and I think about the whole thing ripping away from the brick wall and smashing me to pieces. I listen to the sounds of all the TVs blaring, with Spanish and news and sports and a Three’s Company re-run all playing at once.\r\n\r\nWhat happened to Frank? I bet the neighbors ask Ma that all the time. Your blue-eyed boy! So handsome! Branch manager of his company, once. On his way up, working downtown! And now, shit.\r\n\r\nKids are hollering and crying around the building, and I watch Ma inside, dark and blurred through my own reflection on the dirty storm door. Gray walls, dirt, skin, hair, smoke. Since I got back, the kids in the neighborhood all think Ma got married again…to me. Now we are both gray.\r\n\r\nAfter a little while, I go back inside. A breath of smoke and a couple of mosquitoes follow me in. My hands are shaking. I fix myself some orange juice in one of Ma’s pink plastic tumblers. “Ma?” I ask.\r\n\r\nShe knows what I’m talking about. Ma says, “In the cupboard, behind the cereal.” She waves me off like she’s sick of looking at me.\r\n\r\nI reach up, grab the bottle and turn my back to Ma and Loretta, flooding vodka into the juice with three noisy glugs. Then I screw the cap on tight and set it back into hiding.\r\n\r\nLoretta asks Ma—right in front of me—why she bothers to buy it for me. She’s got no respect. That much is clear. Loretta knows that Ma needs the money for her rent and electric, and sometimes she has to pay late. So who do they blame? Me.\r\n\r\n“I hate it when he has too much,” Ma says back, looking over her shoulder at me like I’m not really there, like I’m just a picture of myself. “He turns into a mean S-O-B. But I just can’t stand to see him shake like that. A man needs his drink and cigarettes.”\r\n\r\nAfter all that time, Loretta forgets the point of the story about the Indian, so she says goodnight and goes upstairs, whistling some song she probably invented on the spot. Me and Ma sit alone in the apartment, with the black-and-white TV fuzzing in and out on Fantasy Island. I flip through Ma’s vacation brochures that Loretta picks up for her every week, even though Ma never goes—or has gone—anywhere. She’s too sick and old now, but she still dreams: See the Caribbean! One of them says, Europe! with TWA.\r\n\r\nMa leans over the card table—as best as she can—and says to me in a low voice, “Loretta’s stealing from me.”\r\n\r\n“Loretta?” I say, “Why in the hell would you think that?”\r\n\r\nMa tells me that last Tuesday, when she went to the doctor, me and Loretta were the only ones who had a key. Ma can trust me, she knows that much. Before she left for the doctor, she had her shoebox of medicine out to make a little bit of money. Her sister Bernice came by with a wad of cash to pay her back for the Valium she got last week, and she gave Ma $20 extra for the Tylenol 3’s she could use for her bad knees. Bernice always has pains someplace. Altogether, Ma had about $50 cash, some in ones and fives, with two tens, in a plain white envelope tucked into her daily devotion booklet. When she got back from seeing the doctor, the two tens were gone.\r\n\r\nMa says she’s looked everywhere for that $20. She’s just sick about it. She thinks maybe Loretta’s trying to make her think she’s going senile. That week, Ma’d planned to make a nice fancy Jell-O salad for July Fourth.\r\n\r\n“Frankie,” Ma says, telling me the story, “I asked Loretta, ‘will you go in that cabinet and fetch me my new Tupperware—that Jell-O mold? Loretta says, ‘There’s no Tupperware mold here, Syl. You must be going crazy!”\r\n\r\nMa got all mad, she says. I can just see her in my head, steaming and thumping her way across the room in her walker to go look for it herself. It really was gone. She says she thought maybe she really was going nutso, until later on, when she hears the Albanian girl down the way say to Loretta, “What a beautiful Jell-O ring!”\r\n\r\nI tell Ma she must be watching too many Perry Mason detective shows. But, even if the money was stolen too, she shouldn’t blame Loretta. It’d be a safer bet wondering about another neighbor, or even her sister, Bernice. Bernice might be the type to take the money, I say to Ma, and Loretta could’ve taken the Jell-O mold. We both know there’s no way Ma’s crazy. She’s on top of everything that goes on in this building.\r\n\r\nI get up and fix myself another drink, this time leaving the bottle out in the open. So what? It’s just me and Ma now. I have nothing to hide. Besides, she says I’m better with a few drinks in me, anyway. Nicer. More relaxed. It makes me a better person all-around. Ask anyone, she’ll say. She used to say the same thing about my Pop, of course. She used to say that in Pop’s last days, around about the time the cirrhosis set in, if they took the drink away from him at that point, that would have killed him.\r\n\r\nLoretta hasn’t been gone more than twenty minutes when Maria, the Albanian girl, runs downstairs to Ma’s apartment in her nightgown, looking all confused.\r\n\r\n“Whatsa matter, Maria?” Ma hollers, figuring she’s just being a crazy foreigner. We know how they get sometimes.\r\n\r\nMaria takes a deep breath. “I was walking by Loretta’s window,” she says, “I see her lying on the floor, holding her arm. I say, Loretta! Are you OK? And she does not answer!”\r\n\r\n“Then I guess she must be OK,” Ma says back, “Otherwise she would’ve said.”\r\n\r\nThis makes sense to me, but Maria keeps on.\r\n\r\n“But what if she’s having a heart attack or something? Then she can’t say she’s OK?” Maria says.\r\n\r\nSometimes Maria can be a real pain in the ass. Ma looks over at me. She’s said her piece and prefers to mind her own business. I’m in charge now.\r\n\r\n“OK, Maria,” I say in my slow, deep voice that comes as naturally as stars in the nighttime after a couple of drinks, “Go back upstairs, and ask Loretta if she needs to go to the hospital. If she says yes, or if she doesn’t answer, then we know she needs a doctor.”\r\n\r\nI feel pretty good making important decisions like this. I like the sound of my voice giving orders. I missed my calling. Or lost it, someplace.\r\n\r\nMaria runs up to Loretta’s apartment in her little nightie, naked skinny legs showing off to the whole world, and we can hear her hollering through the screen window, “Loretta? Do you need to go to the hospital?”\r\n\r\nMe and Ma listen from downstairs. I stick to Ma like glue. No way do I want to see Loretta in some kind of undressed condition. On the wall over the door, Jesus is hanging off a cross with a hopeless look on his face. I try to remember a prayer, something to fit this mess. I can’t think of a single one.\r\n\r\nAfter a second, Maria runs back downstairs, her bare feet squeaking and slipping on the floor, and I think if she’s not careful, she might also fall and have to go to the hospital. Maria says, “Loretta said, ‘No.’ But she’s still lying there, and crying. She says things I do not understand!”\r\n\r\nI say to Ma, “Awright, awright! I don’t care what Loretta says! Call an ambulance!”\r\n\r\nMa starts in on reminding me how ambulances don’t like to come into Summit unless it’s an emergency, and how Loretta did actually say ‘No,’ so this probably isn’t an emergency. She decides to call the police department, instead, and see what they think.\r\n\r\nIn five minutes flat, an ambulance is outside, courtesy of the Cook County Police, and they’re busting in to get Loretta. She looks even fatter on the stretcher, with her yellow hair flopping around everywhere, and those big thighs jiggling as the medics carry her down the stairs.\r\n\r\nI take a walk upstairs, figuring I’ll get a better look, now that I know Loretta is dressed and out of there. And whaddoya know? There, sitting right on Loretta’s kitchen table, is Ma’s Jell-O mold, exactly like she described it. I walked back downstairs, where the ambulance guy was asking Ma what Loretta’s last name is. No one knows for sure. Something Polish, with a “K.” Ma thinks it might be “Kowalski,” or maybe “Kuzminski.” I go back up the stairs and inside Loretta’s to look for some mail or ID or something to solve the mystery. I take the Jell-O mold on the way out, trying to figure how to break it to Ma that she was right about half of it, for certain.\r\n\r\nNot long after, Ma gets a call from the hospital. Loretta died. Ma has a hard time with this, saying, “She was my best friend,” over and over. I knew that Ma wasn’t crying only for Loretta, though. She was also crying about that stupid Jell-O mold, and for how she couldn’t trust anyone no more. She was probably crying over me, too, and how because of some asshole things I did, she won’t see her grandchildren again. Maybe she was also crying for Summit, this shit-hole of a town, and how she’ll never get to Europe and the Caribbean.\r\n\r\nIt makes me sick just thinking about it. There’s nothing I can do to change anything. It’s just another reminder crashing into my head. All the reminders of what a shit I am run me over, like I’m road kill on the highway: Get Out! That’s what Carol said to me, how many years ago now? And I got in the car and drove away and never saw her and my girls again. I try not to think about it.\r\n\r\nI want to tell Ma that it won’t always be this way, that she can trust some people. That not everywhere’s like Summit and not everyone is like me. I wish I could tell her all good things, like she used to tell me when I was a snot-nosed six-year-old with skinned knees. I want to say, “Don’t worry, Ma, I’m sure you’ll outlive me.” But I left my words someplace back in my third drink, and all I can leak out is, “Forget about it.”\r\n\r\nThe commotion is long gone now, it’s after ten, and I’m on drink number five. I say, “Hey, Ma, I’m going out to get some air.”\r\n\r\nThis is the first time she smiles at me in what feels like years.\r\n\r\n“Sure, go get some air,” Ma says with a sort of a laugh. Saying, “Go get some air,” in itself is kind of a joke on a summer night in Summit. I leave my cup on the counter and carry what’s left of the bottle out with me.\r\n\r\nIt’s hard to see where I’m headed, since it’s starting to get dark now. In the dim light, the alley outbuildings look like tombs, a New Orleans-style City of the Dead. The sheds line up all down the back drive, like those above-ground crypts holding bodies that the swamp can’t swallow. You can’t keep a good man down.\r\n\r\nI think about my Pop. I try to picture him: young, slim and dark-haired, like when I was little. On my sixth birthday, Pop took me to a Cubs game. The two of us sat in the bleachers at Wrigley Field, eating hotdogs. I drank soda, Pop drank beer. And then, the game was over and the crowds piled out like it was a fire drill. The Cubs were gone. Everyone was gone. It was just me and Pop and the people cleaning up. Pop wasn’t budging. I tried and tried, but after so many beers, he wouldn’t open his eyes. I cried and hit at his shoulder saying, “Pop! Pop! Wake up!”\r\n\r\nWhy would I remember that day, and still miss my Pop? Go figure.\r\n\r\nI lit up another cigarette and drew the smoke in one slow breath, remembering something else: remembering how I tried to copy that cool smoke rhythm of his. Inhaling, then speaking without a single puff of smoke sneaking out. Pop made it look so easy. I used to hide out with the kids from the end of the street, all of them sitting on their powder-blue tiled bathroom floor with stolen butts from Pop’s ashtray. Holding the butt up to my lips, I’d strike a match and show them how to suck in hard and get it to light up again. I had those kids thinking he taught me, like some important father-son time, with a radio or TV-show voice talking over it, explaining to the crowd: now Frank is a man. The truth was, of course, that I taught myself in the basement once everyone had gone to bed. But I had half-believed that my Pop really did sit next to me on the front porch sometimes; coaching me, breath by breath, how to do it. I imagined it in my head so many times that it had just about become real. I believed if I could do that, become that… I don’t know. Maybe something would change.\r\n\r\nBut nothing ever changes in Summit. Not in my thirty years since high school. Or in the forty since I learned to smoke. Not with dead Loretta lying on her floor and taking the blame for that stolen money. Not even with Carol switching me off faster than a light switch. What did she do with my clothes and my cigarettes? How could she, did she, live without me?\r\n\r\nI would have paid Ma back.\r\n\r\nMy bottle and my head are light and the sky is now very dark. I’m home, back home, in Summit. Home, even the word sounds heavy, full of the long O’s of go and old and cope. I catch myself looking around, checking to make sure it’s really true. I feel like I’m a light waft of pollution lingering overhead, around and through that town this night. Every night. I’m a whisper of embarrassment—I’m that bad thing in the past that people try to shove down and ignore.\r\n\r\nI take another gulp from his bottle and enjoy the burn.\r\n\r\nThe way I see it, so what if I don’t live up to any of their expectations! Since when has life lived up to mine? I never asked to be here. I didn’t ask for anything. I never get what I ask for, anyway.\r\n\r\nLights pop on in the scattered windows of Ma’s building behind me, like randomly lit candles for prayer. My shadow grows, running out from my feet and away into the blackest, darkest corners. It escapes my body, blending in against the dumpster, the cars, the garbage, the Earth.\r\n\r\nMy chapped lips burn again on the last crisp sting of vodka, and every dead bud on my tongue comes alive as that sip rolls over like the finest wine. I miss my Pop. I miss my wife and girls. But deep down, I have nothing to worry about, it’ll all be yesterday again soon.\r\n\r\nThe train-crossing gate in the distance tinkles like church bells, the apartment rooftops bend at sharp angles, and the TV antennas and cable dishes are like steeples growing high up toward God in the night. I’m brought down to my knees from the beauty of it, and I pray. I pray that it will be enough that I left Summit for a while. I pray that I will outlive my Ma. I pray for courage to ask her for money to drink tomorrow. I sing Holy, Holy, Holy,praises to my maker; the alley is full of Thy glory!\r\n\r\nThe heating vents evolve into the grandest of cathedral spires and the buzz of the highway is a hymn sung by the heavenly hosts themselves. Hail, Ma! Mother of Me! I am her gift! Cherubim dance the skies, and I see my little girl’s skinned knees and missing front teeth and all the movement and color I remember from my own childhood. The blood of my father has cleansed me! It washes warmly across my face, and down my neck. The fragrant smoke of my Pop’s breath surrounds me like incense. Pop’s remains mingle with and rise up and out from the soil—I can taste him on my lips and tongue. Heavenly Father! I am redeemed! Sanctified by the tears of my sweet, sweet, Ma, and good neighbor Loretta; I feel tender ghosts wrap me in towels wet with myrrh and love. I know now, throughout my being, that I am as fine and pure a soul as God has made me. The sturdy hands of archangels lift me up into the light, swaying me gently, gently, like a baby. That great stone will soon be rolled away, it will be yesterday again. Amen!\r\n\r\nAnd with that, the familiar wail of an ambulance siren fills my ears, echoing down the long concrete-walled highway, past Ma’s, past the Quick Stop Shop, past the train station, but not quite fast enough to get down the long dark alleyway, where I’m laying face-down, waiting to meet up with Loretta and have her finish her story.', 'As former director of the Writers Voice literary center in St. Louis, Julia Gordon-Bramer has worked with luminaries in literature such as Ken Kesey, Allen Ginsberg, and Gloria Steinem.

(27, 'Chicago Monologue', '6:00am. The alarm rang loudly. Chris woke up. He scratched his head. Jimmy lay on the mattress in the living room. Jimmy pulled the blanket over his head not wanting to get up. Chilyong came out from the bathroom. He had a yellow towel saying “Chicago Soccer Club” around his neck.\r\n\r\n“Wake up. We have to eat breakfast,” Chilyong shouted while he dried his hair. Chris had half-opened eyes as he straggled to the bathroom. Chilyong took the blanket away from Jimmy. He kicked Jimmy in the butt. Jimmy hesitated a little and got up. He put on a mahogany shirt he wore the day before and followed Chilyong to the kitchen. Chilyong opened the refrigerator. He took out bread and soy milk.\r\n\r\n“Bread and soy milk again. Don’t we have noodles or something?” Jimmy grumbled.\r\n\r\n“What? Who finished a whole box of ramen noodles in three days?” Chilyong said.\r\n\r\nJimmy picked up the bread with a smirk on his face. Chris came to the kitchen. He wiped his face with a paper towel.\r\n\r\n“Man, you should use the towel in the bathroom, not a paper towel in kitchen,” Chilyong scolded Chris like a stepmother.\r\n\r\n“Anyway, when do we all get a vacation? How come I’m always tired?” Jimmy yawned and poured soy milk in a Styrofoam cup.\r\n\r\n“That’s why I keep telling you to stop watching videos till two in morning.” A piece of bread fell out of Chilyong’s mouth.\r\n\r\nJimmy replied he would quit his job soon. He massaged his lower back. Chris reminded them that Mr. Lim had promised increased wages and paid vacations soon.\r\n\r\n“What the heck. Do you really believe him? He said that six months ago. Look. He says he’s an elder at his church so he has to go every Sunday. But he forces his employees to work on the Sabbath,” Jimmy complained.\r\n\r\n“Let’s stop talking about meaningless things,” Chilyong said. He got up.\r\n\r\nChris and Jimmy followed him.\r\n\r\n.  .  .\r\n\r\nInterstate 90 wasn’t as congested as they predicted. They arrived on time at the beauty supply store in South Side. Mr. Lim, who was completely bald, drank coffee in his tiny office.\r\n\r\n“Look, Mrs. Higgins, I don’t know why. I just can’t start the day without drinking coffee,” he declared.\r\n\r\nMrs. Higgins was skinny like a chop stick. She was in her forties. Still, she looked like she was over sixty. Mrs. Higgins married an American G.I. in Dongdoochun, th Korea. Then she moved to America. Her husband played drums for his rock band. He was an alcoholic, too. He beat Mrs. Higgins with his drum sticks when drunk. A year ago he struck her for forty minutes like a drum solo. Afterwards, he said he had no passion left for playing drums. Eventually, he left her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Higgins bitterly smiled. She said she couldn’t drink coffee. Mr. Lim had to leave to play golf. He ordered Chilyong to display chemicals on the empty shelves.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lim, I’ll pray for you to win money playing golf today.” Jimmy changed his tune from earlier.\r\n\r\n“Thank you. Anyway, keep an eye on Negroes. They’re always ready to steal. Especially the ones with ‘Jesus is my boss’ shirts. Watch out for those lazy bitches.” Mr. Lim left the store.\r\n\r\nHe opened his white Lexus. The lid on his coffee popped off. Hot coffee spilled over his hand. Mr. Lim sharply screamed as if he were delivering twins.\r\n\r\n.  .  .\r\n\r\nA black mom and her daughter suspiciously sent a signal to each other in the corner. Chilyong noticed them and watched carefully. He caught a black girl trying to steal a blonde hair-piece last month. Mr. Lim praised Chilyong and took all the employees to a fancy Chinese restaurant, The Forbidden City.\r\n\r\nChilyong saw the daughter take a can of hair spray. She tossed it to her mom who quickly put it in her jacket. Chilyong’s shiny broken English hit the air.\r\n\r\n“What you do over there?” Chilyong rushed to them. “I see you my eye, I see you my eye!”\r\n\r\nHis high tone voice made the black lady’s face even darker. She didn’t back off. She struck back screaming. Chilyong pointed to her jacket.\r\n\r\n“I saw her steal hairspray!” Chilyong tried to put his hand in the mother’s jacket.\r\n\r\n“Don’t touch me!” she screeched insisting he couldn’t touch her body which was the temple of the Holy Spirit.\r\n\r\n“I calling Chicago cop. I calling FBI,” Chilyong shouted. He took the mobile phone out of his pocket.\r\n\r\nThe black lady took the hairspray out from her jacket. She smashed it to the ground.\r\n\r\n“Son of a bitch!” the daughter spat and followed her mom.\r\n\r\n“Fucking bitches.” Chilyong’s nostrils were shaking. \r\n\r\nMrs. Higgins called Mr. Lim to tell him what had happened. Mr. Lim was on the seventh hole. He lauded Chilyong’s accomplishment over the phone. Chilyong humbly said he was just lucky.\r\n\r\n.  .  .\r\n\r\nChris was cooking Korean barbecue in the frying pan. Jimmy looked at the pan full of pork. Chilyong was glowing with pride.\r\n\r\n“You’re just incredible. How could you tell they were thieves? Is it because you’re a thief yourself, taking money from the register?” Jimmy shook his head and glanced at Chilyong.\r\n\r\nChilyong said he could figure it out just by looking at someone. Chris put some pork on plates. Chilyong and Jimmy were quick to eat it. Their chopsticks clicked away busily. Chris’s cell phone started vibrating on the floor. Setting his chopsticks on the table, Chris picked up the phone. It was Thomas. Chris used to work with Thomas at the warehouse on Addison Avenue.\r\n\r\n“Hi, Thomas. I know I should have called you. But you know how busy life gets. How is it going?” Chris asked.\r\n\r\n“I’m with my friend Alcohol right now. You know,” Thomas answered with a chuckle.\r\n\r\nChris said he would stop by tomorrow. He hung up the phone. Jimmy shook water from some lettuce. Jimmy asked him why Chris stayed in contact with Thomas. Chris didn’t say anything and ate some rice.\r\n\r\nChilyong quipped, “It’s a waste of time. Don’t ask Thomas not to drink.”\r\n\r\n“Hey, I heard from Youngwoo that Thomas brought a gun to work one day. Fortunately, he didn’t have any bullets,” Jimmy commented with worry.\r\n\r\nChris didn’t let a word come out of his mouth. Thomas was drinking every day since he lost his wife. His wife had worked at the drycleaner near Northwestern University. A couple of months ago, she ran away with a Mexican pants-pressing man she met there. \r\n\r\n“What the fuck is this? Why did I come to Chicago? Look at me. My wife ran away with a Mexican guy. I will look for them. I’ll kill them both. I swear it. I’ll shoot them and kill myself.” Thomas poured more soju in his stomach and cursed.\r\n\r\n.  .  .\r\n\r\nChilyong cleaned up the table. Jimmy tore a piece off of an adult magazine page. He used it as a toothpick. Afterwards he called his girlfriend Carrie. She went to an art school downtown. They had met at The Paper Plane on Lincoln Avenue. Jimmy lied that he was a student at Northwestern University. He claimed he was majoring in general business. She completely believed him.\r\n\r\nChilyong complained that Jimmy was selfish. Jimmy should introduce Chilyong and Chris to some girls as well. Chilyong said he hadn’t had a girl for the last six years. He even threatened that Jimmy would regret it if he continued to be selfish. Jimmy saw Chilyong’s serious face as a rotten potato. Jimmy promised to let them meet some of Carrie’s friends in the future. Jimmy flew out of house like a swallow.\r\n\r\n“Let’s go out to the balcony,” Chris told Chilyong.\r\n\r\n“Good idea.”\r\n\r\nWinter breezes blew through Chris’s hair gently. The vivid night view of downtown invaded Chilyong’s eyes.\r\n\r\n“No matter where you are in Chicago, you see Sears Tower. It looks like a big black cock,” Chilyong said.\r\n\r\nChris laughed and brushed his hair.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what the heck I’m doing here. I work at beauty shop, come home, eat, watching TV,” Chilyong said. He put a cigarette in his mouth.\r\n\r\n“You’re not the only one living like that,” Chris said. He took a cigarette as well. “Is there anything that could make our lives better?”\r\n\r\n“At least Jimmy has girl,” Chilyong said.\r\n\r\n“Come on man, let’s drink some beer.” Chris threw his cigarette at the Sears Tower in the distance.\r\n\r\n.  .  .\r\n\r\nJimmy parked his car near the Adler Planetarium. Shimmering lights from the buildings on Michigan Avenue shattered on Lake Michigan. Jimmy was slipping Carrie pants down. Carrie erotically sighed. He put his head between her legs.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” Carrie screamed louder.\r\n\r\nThe John Hancock Center across the lake turned to purple.\r\n\r\n.  .  .\r\n\r\nJimmy opened the door. He carefully crept into the apartment. He knew the room despite the darkness. He was about to lie down on his mattress when he heard a voice in the bathroom. It was Chilyong speaking with his mom.\r\n\r\n“Mom, please wait for me. I’ll save money and send it for your surgery. Don’t worry about me, mom. You know me, I get along anywhere. Chicago is such a beautiful city. How about Minjung? I heard she works at the restaurant.”\r\n\r\nJimmy listened to Chilyong’s conversation. Chilyong came out of the bathroom. Quickly, Jimmy lay on his mattress pretending he was sleeping.\r\n\r\nChilyong went out to the balcony. The John Hancock Center was watching him with indifference. Chilyong smiled with the effect of a lonely winter.\r\n\r\n.  .  .\r\n\r\n “Man, sushi lunch at church? What great payback it is!” Jimmy exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“I guess they collected some money.” Chilyong picked his teeth with a toothpick.\r\n\r\nIt was Sunday afternoon. They had just returned from Chicago Korean Presbyterian Church.None of them was interested in anything about election, predestination, or salvation. However, they each had existential reasons for attending. Chilyong went for meeting a woman with American citizenship. Jimmy went for the free lunches. Chris went because he didn’t want to stay at home alone.\r\n\r\nChilyong talked about a new girl that had come to the church. He said she was full of sexual energy, looking for a man to press her hard. Chilyong spilled a lascivious smirk. He clenched his fist hard. He said he was the man who would satisfy her purpose. Jimmy laughed at him saying Chilyong needed to look in a mirror.\r\n\r\nChilyong got angry, “I tell Carrie truth about you, Jimmy.”\r\n\r\n“She doesn’t know the home number, just my cell number,” Jimmy smiled.\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ll call her at this number.” Chilyong produced a hidden card.\r\n\r\nJimmy’s face went dead.\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“Last night, when you were asleep, your phone was ringing. It said ‘My daling.’ I’m very disappointed Northwestern student doesn’t even spell right for ‘darling.’ You miss the ‘r.’”\r\n\r\nChris, who was listening to their dialogue, broke down laughing. Chilyong laughed along with him. At last, Jimmy laughed too. Their laughing spread throughout the small apartment. \r\n\r\n.  .  .\r\n\r\nDarkness engulfed Thomas’s room. He was eating instant ramen noodles. His eyes were like ponds where nothing could live. He took a bite of radish kimchi Chris had brought last week. He got up suddenly and went to the kitchen. He grabbed the cheap whiskey and drank greedily. A tear rolled down his face. He bit another radish kimchi.\r\n\r\n.  .  .\r\n\r\nChris looked around the Happy Beauty parking lot confused. Mrs. Higgins was not there. She always came first. At noon, he heard the news from her sister that Mrs. Higgins had gone to the hospital. No one was sure how sick she was. She was in serious condition, though. Mr. Lim had a wrinkle between his eyebrows all day. Mrs. Higgins often worked seven days a week. Chris sometimes told her she needed to take a rest. She didn’t listen. She told him it was better to work than stay at home. Mrs. Higgins had a decent character and cared for others. Her lunch was taken at the warehouse after everyone had theirs. She ate the same thing everyday: tofu and kimchi. One day Chilyong asked her how she could eat the same lunch all the time. Her reply was a lecture on the rich nutrition of tofu and kimchi. Now, Mrs. Higgins was in hospital fighting to live. Chris felt like praying for her.\r\n\r\nHe closed his eyes, “Heavenly Father. Be close to her. I acknowledge that every life is in your hands. Please heal her pain and have mercy on her. Father, she has nothing but you. You said if I have the faith of a mustard seed, I could move a mountain. I don’t ask you to move a mountain. I pray to you for Mrs. Higgins. Father, I trust you and I pray in the name of Jesus of Nazareth.”\r\n\r\n.  .  .\r\n\r\nA black coffin holding Mrs. Higgins’s body was being lowered into the ground. Chilyong wept hard as he remembered his own sick mother. Mr. Lim wiped his tears with a white handkerchief. Mrs. Higgins had been in the last stage of uterine cancer. She had known about it for a year. She didn’t have any passion for living longer. She desired to leave the old world and enter the new world.\r\n\r\n“God, take care of her spirit. You know she had a painful life here,” Chris grumbled at the air.  \r\n\r\n.  .  .\r\n\r\nJimmy walked fast. He was meeting Carrie at the coffee shop. Carrie waved to him from the table. She looked exceptionally pretty wearing a pastel green sweater. Jimmy sat on the chair.\r\n\r\n“Jimmy, let’s forget the coffee and go to a bar,” she got up and said.\r\n\r\nThey visited The Paper Plane. The bar was packed with Korean people. A waiter with a shaved head guided them to the table at the corner.\r\n\r\n“What would you like to order?”\r\n\r\nCarrie ordered snail with vegetable and two bottles of beer. The waiter brought the beer first. Carrie poured beer into glasses and handed it to Jimmy. She held the glass high for a toast. Jimmy gave a puzzled look and clinked glasses with her. She ate ground bean. The waiter came to the table and took the empty bottles. Carrie ordered two more beers. The waiter nodded and said nothing.\r\n\r\n“What’s wrong with you? Are you okay?” Jimmy asked.\r\n\r\n“Hey, I’m paying for everything. There’s nothing wrong with this,” she defended and took a cigarette.\r\n\r\nJimmy lit it for her. She inhaled and spit out the smoke. It interrupted his vision for a moment.\r\n\r\n“Jimmy,” she tenderly called his name and glanced at him, “I’m going back to Seoul.”\r\n\r\nJimmy was instantly shocked. He knew she would go back one day. But he didn’t expect it would come so quickly. He took a cigarette from his pocket. The clock said it was past two. Only a few were left at the bar. He put his fingers in her pants. Carrie began breathing sensually. He touched her deep inside. She squeezed her body and whispered in his ear.\r\n\r\n“Let’s get out of here.”\r\n\r\nThey arrived at the park. Nobody was around. Carrie slowly inched Jimmy’s pants down. She helped him come inside her. His lips were shaking in ecstasy. He moved his waist hard. Carrie was screaming and clutching his body. Her face was shattered in Jimmy’s drunken eyes. They kissed and shared each other’s breath. Above them shiny stars were all over the city.\r\n\r\nJimmy didn’t say anything as he drove. Carrie leaned her head on his shoulder. He turned his face and looked at her. She was in such a tranquil mood. Carrie grabbed his hand. He took interstate 90 and went downtown. Citrine lights were twinkling. He got off at the Ohio exit. The car hit Michigan Avenue and he made a left turn. Jimmy drove fast on Lake Shore Drive as the John Hancock Center appeared in the back mirror.\r\n\r\nHe rolled down his window. Thunderous wind from Lake Michigan slapped his face.\r\n\r\n“Carrie, I’m sorry.” He disrupted the silence.\r\n\r\nCarrie’s hair blew high hitting the ceiling of the car.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry,” Jimmy repeated, and his voice evanesced into the lake.\r\n\r\n“What are you sorry for?” Carrie shouted above the sound of the wind.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. I really don’t know. I’m just sorry.” Tears flooded Jimmy’s eyes.  \r\n\r\n.  .  .\r\n\r\nIt had been two weeks since Carrie went back to Seoul.\r\n\r\n“Jimmy. Sorry you don’t have nipples to suck anymore,” Chilyong chuckled while he put tuna in the spicy kimchi stew for dinner.\r\n\r\nChicago Cubs and LA Dodgers were playing on WGN. Chilyong was a huge fan of the Cubs. He asserted the Cubs should invest money like the New York Yankees if they ever wanted to win the World Series. The Dodgers’ pitcher stared at the Cubs’ batter. It was the bottom of the ninth. Runners were on second and third. LA was leading three to two. The closer threw the ball. Strike. It was a hundred mile fast ball on the outside. The pitcher could have let the fourth batter on the base by intentional walk. But he decided to handle him. The entire crowd in Wrigley field was up cheering and stomping their feet. The pitcher threw the second pitch. Strike. Chilyong was biting his nails. The pitcher wiped the sweat on his forehead. He threw the third ball. It was nowhere close to the plate. Still, the batter swung his bat. Strike out in three balls. The Cubs continued their fifth losing streak for the third time this year.\r\n\r\n“Cubs just waste money on that useless guy. They need to trade him whatever reason,” Chilyong put on his blue Cubs cap and said. “Let’s get some beer.”\r\n\r\nChris took the keys on the table and followed Chilyong.\r\n\r\n.  .  .\r\n\r\nThe grocery store was crowded. A lady with breasts like Patriotic missiles caught Chilyong’s eyes.\r\n\r\n“Wow. Look at that,” Chilyong sent sincere respect for the size of her breasts.\r\n\r\n“Man, she’d think you would rape her.”\r\n\r\n“Just a second. Okay, I capture picture of her. I use it later in bathroom.”\r\n\r\nChilyong took cheap beer from the refrigerator. Chris wanted fine beer since they had gotten their pay checks. Chris put back the cheap beer and picked one from Germany. They stood at the cash register. The Patriotic lady was right in front of them with shampoo and soap in her hands. Chilyong looked back and forth between the soap and the lady. He momentarily thought how he would like to be a soap bubble on her body. It would be the beginning of eternity, Chilyong deemed. The lady spotted Chilyong and walked out.\r\n\r\n“Is that all?” the cashier asked.\r\n\r\n“That’s it,” Chilyong answered quickly.\r\n\r\n.  .  .\r\n\r\nChris and Jimmy were giggling as they put their ears on the bathroom door.\r\n\r\nChilyong had gone to the bathroom half an hour ago. He was masturbating. Close to reaching climax, he sounded like a man with bird flu. All of a sudden, Chris threw open the bathroom door. Jimmy took a picture of Chilyong with his phone. The master of masturbation made the novice mistake of not locking the door.\r\n\r\n“Man, you guys really interrupt my only hobby,” Chilyong came at Jimmy like lightning and erased the phone’s evidence. He went off to his room and locked the door. “Good night, kids.”\r\n\r\n.  .  .\r\n\r\nThomas’s eyes were bloodshot. He had pills in his palm. Thomas popped the pills in his mouth, gnashing them with his teeth. It felt like the devil had dominated his tongue. He couldn’t stand it. He threw up. Creamy water spurt from his nose and mouth. Thomas rushed to the sink. He loathed himself. Clenching his fist hard, he punched the fridge door. His skin peeled back and blood came out. Thomas looked at it. He licked the blood.\r\n\r\n.  .  .\r\n\r\nRain drizzled down that morning. It got thicker by noon. Mr. Lim nervously looked at the sky. He worried he might not be able to play golf. He had lost three hundred dollars on golf to Mr. Kim, the owner of Joy Cleaner, last Tuesday. Chris was busy arranging boxes. The small wooden box Mrs. Higgins used for her lunch caught his eye. He missed her. It felt like he could hear her voice.\r\n\r\n“Chris. Chris,” her skinny voice snuck into the warehouse.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Higgins, where are you?” Chris called out.\r\n\r\n“Chris, I’m in the most beautiful place you could imagine. I’m not sick anymore. I didn’t even say goodbye to you, Chris. You were always so nice to me. I remember that always. I truly thank you,” she whispered through the rain. “Chris, I came here to tell you one thing.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?” Chris eagerly craved to hear.\r\n\r\n“Chris, you should escape Chicago. You must get out as soon as possible. You belong to the light. You must go back where you came from. Go back.”\r\n\r\nThe sound of heavy rain stabbed Chris’ heart. He had to use the restroom. Unzipping his pants he peed in the toilet. It sounded similar to the rain outside.\r\n\r\nChris lit a cigarette and went outside. Tiny droplets landed on his eyebrows. He was reminded of a soft tofu restaurant in Seoul he often visited when it rained. He carefully walked through the memory in his mind. He visited the soft tofu restaurant on the east side of Seoul. An old lady greeted him. She said her son had moved to America leaving her alone. Chris ordered soft tofu jigae. She brought it and said it was for free.\r\n\r\n“Thank you for your kindness.”\r\n\r\nHe finished the soft tofu and left the restaurant. Chris kept walking. He arrived at the apartment where he used to live. The video shop next to the apartment was still there. He discovered the hair salon with its open sign. He touched his hair and went inside.\r\n\r\n“How I cut?” a lady smiled and asked.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. Cut whatever you want,” Chris watched himself in the mirror.\r\n\r\n His black curly hair was snipped and floated to the ground. The lady was so fabulous at making style. Chris looked in the mirror. He liked his new look.\r\n\r\n“Man, what are you thinking? Let’s get out of here. Time’s up.” Jimmy and Chilyong found Chris in the warehouse.\r\n\r\nChris looked at the clock on the wall. It was 8:09 pm.\r\n\r\n“It looks terrible. You should let me cut your hair next time,” Jimmy rustled Chris’s head.\r\n\r\n“How ‘bout we go pig feet house?” Chilyong recommended, getting in the car.\r\n\r\nChris and Jimmy nodded their heads saying nothing. They arrived at the pig foot house in Niles.\r\n\r\n“Changchodong Pig Foot House.” Jimmy read aloud the blinking neon sign and went in.\r\n\r\n“We’ll have soju and medium pig feet.”\r\n\r\nA waitress with a deep wrinkle on her forehead took the order.\r\n\r\n“She looks like she just got out of hell,” Jimmy muttered.\r\n\r\nChilyong laughed.\r\n\r\n“Anyway, you know which part of body has most wrinkles?” Chilyong asked Chris. “The ball,” Chilyong answered his own question and separated his chopsticks.\r\n\r\n“Come on man, just pour some soju,” Jimmy was holding a glass.\r\n\r\nChris stared at the parking lot outside. He could see rain falling on his car’s front window. Ruby color neon landed on Chris’s lips. Chilyong saw it and imagined how Chris would make a pretty woman. Jimmy put salt around his soju glass and drank it. \r\n\r\n“Have you had a margarita?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Matahari? I have ‘bout six months ago.” Chilyong didn’t even get the name right.\r\n\r\n“Stupid man. It goes like this.” Jimmy took another shot with salt.\r\n\r\nChilyong said Jimmy needed to stop drinking like a jerk. Chilyong emptied his glass and gave it to Jimmy. Chilyong poured soju into it. Jimmy swiftly finished it and took a cigarette. His face suddenly darkened.\r\n\r\n“Chilyong, how is your mother? Does she get sick a lot?” he carefully asked.\r\n\r\nChilyong looked annoyed and managed to stay calm. He filled his glass with soju with an absent look. He looked at Chris and Jimmy for several seconds. Chilyong smiled and drank his soju. The alcohol went deeply into his spirit. He said he wanted to change the subject. But an awkward ambience existed.\r\n\r\n“Do you need money for her surgery?” Chris continued.\r\n\r\nJimmy poured more soju in Chilyong’s glass. Chilyong opened his mouth.\r\n\r\n“She’s really sick. Can’t even walk. My sister quit high school and working at restaurant kitchen. My sister takes care of her.” Tears welled in Chilyong’s eyes. “It takes lots of money for surgery.”\r\n\r\nAs Jimmy listened to Chilyong, he drank half the soju. He smashed the bottle on the table. A group of guys sitting next to him stared at Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“Fuckers, making so much noise,” one of them told Jimmy.\r\n\r\nJimmy sent them axe eyes.\r\n\r\n“Look at that fucker’s eyes; they’re coming out.” Four men at the table laughed at Jimmy.\r\n\r\nThe anger in Jimmy exploded like a volcano.\r\n\r\n“What the fuck did you say? Huh? Who said that? I’ll kill him!”\r\n\r\nJimmy grasped the bottle and smashed it to the table. He didn’t stop. He threw the table and went completely insane.\r\n\r\n“I’ll kill those fuckers.”\r\n\r\nJimmy threw empty bottles and dishes in the air. The men at the next table seemed scared of Jimmy. The lady owner snatched the phone and called 911.  \r\n\r\n“Cop, cop. Come here fast, fast. Crazy man. Korea crazy man, killing. Here wait for me. Korean. Now come on! Now.” Her broken English stunned even Chilyong who was the king of broken English.\r\n\r\n“You called the police? I’ll burn this shitty pig foot store!” Jimmy threatened.\r\n\r\nChilyong held Jimmy’s arm tightly as he led Jimmy out of the restaurant. Chris drove the car and got out of the parking lot in a hurry.\r\n\r\n“Man, are you crazy? What the heck was that?” Chilyong lit a cigarette and handed it to Jimmy.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. I just… I don’t know.”\r\n\r\nJimmy took a deep drag.\r\n\r\n“Wait a minute. We didn’t pay.” Chilyong threw his cigarette out the window.\r\n\r\nJimmy worried that the owner would describe him as a robber. Chris said if he went back and paid the bill everything would be all right.\r\n\r\n.  .  .\r\n\r\n“I display incredible tolerance because I know you’re a good person.” The owner of the restaurant counted the money Chris gave her for a second time.\r\n\r\nChris bowed twice saying how sorry he was.\r\n\r\n“Anyway, you guys should be careful; DUI mess up life.” She pointed out the headlines in the Korea Daily Newspaper. It said “Police force doubled to stop DUIs.” Chris looked to the corner and went to the bathroom holding his pants.\r\n\r\n.  .  .\r\n\r\nThe Chicago night was getting darker. Koreans were not found just in Korea Town on Lawrence Avenue anymore. Koreans had moved to the suburb areas. They headed home after work every night. Nobody knew where they were going. Nobody knew what they wanted. Maybe, Mrs. Higgins was right…. Chicago was a tomb for them.\r\n\r\n“What you doing, man?” Chilyong tapped Chris who was writing something on a notepad. “Are you writing letter?”\r\n\r\n“Not really. I just write whatever I like to write,” Chris responded.\r\n\r\n“Then you’re writing a memoir.” Jimmy, who lay on mattress, defined Chris’s writing.\r\n\r\n“Memoir? Where you heard that shit?” Chilyong was astonished by Jimmy’s knowledge.\r\n\r\n“Keep in mind that I attended Northwestern.”\r\n\r\nChris took a cigarette pack and got up. Jimmy and Chilyong followed.\r\n\r\nThey went on the balcony. The lost wind stopped to communicate with them. It was an especially gorgeous night. The downtown skyline was spectacular as usual. Chilyong lit up cigarettes and gave them to Chris and Jimmy. They spit out smoke with deep sighs. None of them had a clue what to say. It was always the same pains, the same disappointments, and the same complaints. Chris wanted to say something special. But he couldn’t think of anything. A few minutes of awkward silence flowed. Chilyong lastly opened his dried lips.\r\n\r\n“You guys go to church tomorrow? It’s Sunday.”\r\n\r\n“Church? Hell… let’s go. We don’t have anything to do anyhow,” Jimmy said indifferently.\r\n\r\n“What do we do after church?” Chilyong’s questions continued.\r\n\r\n“Man, I don’t know, maybe take a nap.” Jimmy held both arms high and yawned.

(28, 'A Dying Mother', 'Every morning now my mother calls to warn me of her upcoming death. She says they are calls of life, to remind me that she is still living, but I think they are calls of death, to remind me that she is still dying.\r\n\r\n“Good morning,” she yells through the wires, “I’m still here.” And then she hangs up, and I wait for her to call again the next day.\r\n\r\nBut it is not morning now, and I am not waiting for her call. Instead, I am waiting for the bus and talking with the man we used to call the baker before I learned his real name, which is Harold. Business has been bad since his lazy son took over, but it’s what he expected anyway, he tells me, because contrary to popular opinion, laziness is not something that goes away.\r\n\r\n“Even when they are no longer children?” I ask.\r\n\r\n“They are always children,” he says, “as long as I am alive.” A bus pulls up but it is not mine or Harold’s. After talking about the trees and stores and other members of the neighborhood, the conversation naturally comes back to my mother, and I tell Harold that she is dying. “But how can she die?” he says. “There is so much left for her to do.” By this he means my brother Stephen. He is for another story.\r\n\r\nWhen I get to the hospital my mother immediately asks a very practical question, one I am used to answering. “Where are the children?”\r\n\r\n“They are with Mrs. McCaffery,” I say. Mrs. McCaffery lives upstairs from my mother and has been watching children her entire life. When I was a child, she watched me, and now that I have two children, she watches them. She has never had any children of her own, which my mother attributes to a faulty uterus, but I wonder sometimes if perhaps she is in better working order than the rest of us.\r\n\r\n“Do you have lots of time?” my mother asks. She is sitting straight up in her bed like a child who doesn’t want to go to sleep.\r\n\r\nI look at my watch. “Maybe an hour.”\r\n\r\nI open her shades and realize the view is ugly and sad—half brick wall half deserted office building—so I quickly pull them shut again. Unlike most patients on this floor, my mother is mobile enough to get to this window and open the shades herself if she wants. In fact, if it weren’t for the x-rays to prove the spattering of masses inside both her breasts, it would be hard to believe her sickness. She’s under observation, the doctors keep saying, and in the meantime they’re trying everything they can think of to get my mother to agree to a mastectomy.\r\n\r\n“An hour is good,” she says.  “I can tell you a story of my life.”\r\n\r\n“I have heard them all,” I say because listening is work, and I am tired of working. Besides, I know it will be a recycled story, something about sacrifice and suffering, and I am tired of those things, too.\r\n\r\n“Who taught you to be so swollen-headed?” she says and smoothes out a spot for me on her thin, wrinkled hospital sheet. I sit down.\r\n\r\n“You remember when I learned bowling?”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” I say, and she tells me it didn’t happen. “What part?” I ask. I am expecting her to say the part about winning, because despite what she wants to believe, my mother doesn’t win very often.\r\n\r\n“The whole thing,” she answers. “I was never bowling. I just made up that story to cover another story. A much better one.”\r\n\r\nBut I remember it well. She bowled every Tuesday evening for nearly three months, and at the end of her training, she entered a contest.  She was going to show us how to work hard, how to endure. And she did. She won the contest. When we asked her where her trophy was, she told us it wasn’t important.  What was important, she said, was that it gave her hope.\r\n\r\n“So you lied,” I say, “to your own children?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, please. Are your children never lied to?”\r\n\r\n“No. I never lie to my children,” I say, because I am, in fact, a very good liar. “And why should I believe you now? Maybe you’re lying again.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe, but I am your mother, and you should believe anything a mother says. Especially a dying mother.”\r\n\r\nShe is well-practiced in her use of guilt, as many mothers are, so I resign and ask her to please tell me the story of not bowling. \r\n\r\n“The story of not bowling,” she says, “is a nice title, but it doesn’t fit here. This is a story of presence, not absence.\r\n\r\n“This is the story of Peter, a man I loved while you thought I was bowling. He was thin and happy and so un-American. And the bowling thing is not completely a lie, because that is where I met him. I really wanted to learn to bowl. I brought you and Stephen to Mrs. McCaffery and went to the bowling alley to learn. I tossed the ball into the gutter four times until Peter arrived.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a nice metaphor.”\r\n\r\nShe smiles and tells me not everything is about organization and implications. Some things just happen the way they happen. But she is, of course, a master of craft.\r\n\r\n“And so,” she continues, “on this particular night I was throwing gutterballs and met a man named Peter, and he was so full of love and sweetness I could not resist him.”\r\n\r\n“Like strawberries,” I say.\r\n\r\n“Like chocolate,” she says. She looks up at the white ceiling. The paint is peeling and bubbling above her. “Wait,” she says. “Let me start earlier. The season, the setting, the circumstances of my life—these things are all important. It was winter, and life was cold. Your father had been dead for two years. Stephen was angry, and you were sad. I was alone.”\r\n\r\n“All of this I already know,” I say, because it is not just her life she is telling me about.\r\n\r\nHer room smells of astringents, plastic, and stale food. On top of that it smells of sickness, hopeless possibilities.\r\n\r\n“He was an artist,” she says. “He painted portraits for people at bus stops. Only they weren’t real portraits. He painted what he saw inside them, not outside.”\r\n\r\nI am picturing my mother’s portrait, her largeness inside and out, and also her pain, her loneliness. I tell her about Harold the baker and how concerned he is for her. I tell her he wants to know what will become of her children, but she can see through my questions better than I can myself sometimes. “My children will be okay. They are not children anymore.”\r\n\r\nI think of what Harold said about children always being children, and I wonder who is right. In cases like these, the mother is usually right, but right now,I like his truth better. \r\n\r\n“We are getting away from my story,” she says. “Where was I?”\r\n\r\n“You were unhappy, you decided to take up bowling, and then you met an artist named Peter at the bowling alley.”\r\n\r\n“Yes. He charmed me from the instant I looked at him. He was a terrible bowler, just like I was, so we gave it up together. Instead, we spent each Tuesday night dancing, eating, or watching birds in the park. Always something new. And then it turned out one month that Peter didn’t have enough money to make his child support payments. He had three children. They all lived nearby, and he saw them often. He had the money to pay for two of them, but not all three, and who can make that kind of decision?”\r\n\r\n“Wait a minute. Is this a story about Peter, or about you?”\r\n\r\n“Can’t it be both? Now please, don’t interrupt.”\r\n\r\nI agree to stay quiet until the end of the story. I am never allowed to interfere in my mother’s stories, even when they are my stories, too.\r\n\r\n “Well,” she continues, “Peter’s landlord knew about these portraits he painted. She had always wanted one of her own, so she told him if he painted a picture for her she’d forgive him two months’ rent. Peter agreed. He sat down with her, looked into her eyes, and saw more sadness than he knew what to do with.\r\n\r\n“She told him he was right. The sadness consumed her. And she hoped that if he put it into a picture for her it would leave her. Peter told her he was not in the practice of exorcism, but for her,he would try.\r\n\r\n“First, she told him, he had to listen. He had to know what he was putting on the canvas. And because listening was his job for that moment, he complied. He sat back in a chair, looked out at the sun, and listened to her story.\r\n\r\n“She began by telling him about her first child, the one who died inside of her. She felt its cold, shaky exit one morning as she lay in bed. She didn’t get up. She stayed there all day with the evidence of her child surrounding her, until night when her husband came home. ‘Murder! Murder!’ he cried when he saw the blood.  My wife has been killed!’ She opened her eyes and turned them on him.  ‘No,’ she said, ‘not me.’\r\n\r\n“The next child stayed in her womb for nine months, just as she had prayed it would. She labored two whole nights to get him out and when he came, he was as cold as the first.  It is a cruel irony, she told him, to be suffocated by the very thing that provides you life.\r\n\r\n“It was after this loss that her husband left. He said he could not handle any more blood, not in his name. She begged him to stay, to give her one more child, but he was gone before she even stopped bleeding.\r\n\r\n“Her third child was a girl, the result of a sad man with little conviction. He was gone before the baby arrived. Still, she felt blessed to have the baby. The child was alive, and that gave her great hope. They had many good years together. It was often hard—no money, little clothes—but they had happy times, and happiness is so good for the heart.  Then one day there was a terrible accident.  A group of neighborhood boys had stolen a car and convinced the girl to take a ride with them.  The boys came home, but not the girl.”\r\n\r\nMy mother breaks her narration here and looks at me hard. She doesn’t want me to ask what happened to the girl. It will overtake her story; it will overtake her.\r\n\r\n“Well,” she continues, “the girl had lived twelve more years than her siblings, and for that reason, the woman explained to Peter, it seemed a law of numbers that another child should live the longest. Longer, at least, than she. Peter agreed, and since he knew he could never put all of this into a painting, he decided instead to lie down next to her on her hot, determined floor and give her the child she needed.\r\n\r\n“All of this he told me one Tuesday evening over dinner. We were in his tiny apartment, and he had just put four slices of bacon in a pan for BLT sandwiches. It sizzled and popped as he spoke. Whenever I smell bacon today, I am reminded of that woman. And of her children.\r\n\r\n“And then, because I had children of my own to consider, I told him that we shouldn’t see each other anymore. He said all rightand kissed me with the sweetness of cavities.”\r\n\r\nShe is quiet for a moment and looks down at herself. She puts her hand on her belly.\r\n\r\n“Is that it?  Are you done?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.” She is smiling again, childlike.\r\n\r\n“You did what was right,” I say. My mother looks at me, surprised. “He was no good for you.”\r\n\r\n“No good for me?” she laughs. She gets up from her bed and walks the few steps to her window. She removed all of the cords and sensors attaching her to her monitor last night, the nurses told me, and now all she has on is her hospital gown. It’s open in the back and I can see the folds of skin around her waist. She has asked me to bring her a real nightgown to wear but I keep leaving it at home, afraid that if I bring too much of her world into this hospital room it will remain here.  Have you listened at all to the story? I got rid of him because he was no good for you. For me, he was wonderful.”\r\n\r\n“He was a bum,” I say.\r\n\r\n“What have I done wrong?” she asks. She turns from the window and her gown falls off her left shoulder. I can see her breasts under the cotton: dark and angry. She refuses to cut them off, to free herself from their sickness and burden. “You are such a hopeless girl. And to think when you were born, fresh from my womb, I held you and called you this very same thing you are now so empty of. I wanted nothing but for you to feel safe and warm. Happiness,” she says.\r\n\r\n“I’ve had plenty of happiness,” I say. “Now get back into your bed.”\r\n\r\n“You’ve had. In the past. So what about tomorrow? The next day? You need to have hope for the future, my child. Without that, you have nothing.” I don’t say anything and she sits back down on her bed. Her hospital gown has now fallen off both shoulders, her womanhood exposed like film and underneath,a thumping, pumping of her chest.\r\n\r\n “I never saw Peter again,” she says, “but I looked for him often, at bus stops and on subway platforms. And every time he came into my mind I smiled. Happiness, you know, is good for the heart.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know. But what about the rest of the story? All that loss?”\r\n\r\nI look at the monitor she is no longer hooked up to—a green line still surges every few seconds in affirmation of an absent life—and again I am reminded of the conversation I had with Harold the baker this morning. “A dying mother,” he said, “is so hard to accept.” It was such a childish thing to say, though I did not think it at the time.\r\n\r\n“You see nothing but sadness and suffering,” she tells me. “Despite all of the good you have received.” I look at her and wonder what life she is imagining for me. I think about the way her story began and know mine would start the same way. My husband has been gone for years. My son is angry, and my daughter is sad. And when my mother dies, I will be alone.\r\n\r\n“You will endure,” she says.\r\n\r\nI want to tell her how hard it is, how tired I am all the time, from the minute I open my eyes right up until they are closed again, and how worried I am, constantly, that my son is becoming the kind of boy who doesn’t have a father and that my daughter will consider sadness a friend.\r\n\r\n“You will endure with grace,” she says so effortlessly, as all of her mothering has been, in spite of me. She closes her eyes, calm and distant. I am anything but graceful: this she has always known.\r\n\r\nAnd then, with very much effort, she repeats herself. “With grace!” She stands up next to her bed, her gown now a puddle on the linoleum floor, her eyes scared and angry. She points her finger at me, scolding. “With grace!” she yells.\r\n\r\nI think about the woman in the story and wonder, if Peter had painted her picture, where he would have begun. What colors would he have used? What shapes? Could he ever have known what was inside of her?\r\n\r\nI take a blanket from the chair behind me. “Don’t get upset,” I say to my mother. “It’s okay. Everything’s okay.” I lie her down on her bed and wrap the blanket tightly around her like I did with the children when they were babies, to make them feel like they were inside my womb again, safe and warm.', 'Kelly Lundgren Pietrucha is a writer, teacher and mother (not often in that order) from New Jersey.

(29, 'Customer of Size', 'Richard Foster knows that he is a fat man. He and his wife Eileen Anderson-Foster are at the airport checking in for their flight back east when they first hear the term “customer of size.” When the boy behind the counter, Charles, says it, he uses a soft voice. He says that because of his size, Richard may need to purchase a second seat for the flight. He says that in a minute, he will call a flight attendant over to escort him onto the plane, so that they can check and see if this will be necessary or not. He says it’s policy and that they have to ensure the comfort of all of their customers. He hopes Richard can understand. Richard does not respond except to tell the boy that it’s okay and that he will go along with it. He takes a seat in the waiting area with his wife.\r\n\r\n“Wow,” he says to Eileen, “This is a new one, isn’t it,” he says. “This has never happened before.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t start with me,” Eileen says. “I told you that you needed to do something,” she says, “And now look.” She puts her back to him and then opens her book and looks into it. When a flight attendant comes by a few minutes later and approaches Charles, Eileen walks to the bathroom. She does not turn around.\r\n\r\nCharles talks to the girl in her ear and then points his finger over at Richard. The two of them nod their heads. “Mr. Foster,” Charles says from behind the counter in a minute, “We’re all set.”\r\n\r\nRichard straightens his suit and tie before he makes his way over. He walks like he knows people are watching. He extends his hand to the girl, who is a pretty young thing, and he gives her a firm shake. Charles introduces her as Joyce. When she greets him she says, “You’re my first customer of size, Mr. Foster,” with a big smile, like she’s won something.\r\n\r\n“Well,” Richard says, “Fancy that,” smiling back. “You’re the first flight attendant who says I’m too fat,” he tells her, grinning. His voice is precise. “So I guess we’re even.” He looks up at Charles, whose face has become bright red. He is fussing with some papers on the counter, and Richard says, “Well, the first or the second, anyway.”\r\n\r\nJoyce lets out a giggle and starts walking toward the plane. “Follow me,” she says, and then she makes a point of turning around and waving her fingers at Charles. There is something playful about the way she does it, and it makes Richard wonder. Charles gets a goofy smile on his face and waves back. When Richard looks over at him, his eyes dart back to his papers. It is quiet for a minute, and then Joyce says as they walk, “So, what is it that you do for a living, Mr. Foster?”\r\n\r\nRichard takes a second. Girls like Joyce don’t talk with him. He wants to get the tone right. “Oh, dear,” he says. “You wouldn’t believe me if I told you.”\r\n\r\n “Come on,” she says. “Try me.”\r\n\r\n“Okay,” and then feeling clever, he adds, “But I will not tolerate any laughs out of you, young lady.” He shakes his finger at the girl and says, “Under no circumstances can you laugh. Understood?”\r\n\r\n“Understood,” Joyce says with a nod and a smile. She opens the door of the plane and lets Richard move down the aisle in front of her. She rests her hand on his back as he passes. An older flight attendant, who is checking things here and there in first class, looks at both of them for a time, and then looks away without saying anything.\r\n\r\n“Okay,” he says to Joyce as they make their way to the second part of the plane, “I’m a professional wrestler,” he says, looking back at her. “You’ve heard of The Tornado right?” he says.\r\n\r\nJoyce scrunches up her face. For a minute, she cannot tell if this is a joke. When she catches Richard’s eye and sees a little squint, she laughs. He says, “Oh, all right. You’ve got me,” and then, “I sell Bibles for a living. From door to door.”\r\n\r\n“Come on,” she says, laughing again, “what do you do really?” she begs.\r\n\r\n“No. No,” he says, turning red. “That one is no joke.” Right away he adds, “Do you have a Bible, dear?”\r\n\r\nJoyce says, “Oh. I’m sorry,” and then, “Yes. I have a Bible—I think I do at least.”  Then she adds, “I haven’t heard of door to door in a while though, that’s all.” She directs him toward the first seat in coach. She says, “Here you go, Mr. Foster. Try this one on for size,” and when she says this, she winks and pats at his shoulder with care.\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t always this fat, you know,” he tells her, “I had my day,” he says. He sits down in the aisle seat. “It fits,” he says, holding his palms up in the air. “See that? Didn’t I tell you this was going to be a breeze?” he says.\r\n\r\n“Hey,” she says. “There’s nothing wrong with it. I’d be bigger myself if it wasn’t for this job,” she says. “They weigh us, you know—it’s a nightmare really,” she tells him, and then, “So far so good, Mr. Foster. But we still have a few things to check.” She reaches over his lap for the seat belt.\r\n\r\n“Let me,” he says. He tugs at the metal piece with one hand and carefully guides all of the fabric out with his other hand. He pulls the fabric over his lap and says, “You see. Everything is going to be fine.” He presses the two pieces together but there is no click. He keeps his hand over it and then smiles up at Joyce.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Foster,” she says. “I don’t think I heard any click. Can you move your hand for a second so I can get a look?”\r\n\r\nRichard lets go, and the belt falls loose on his lap. “Let me give it another try,” he says. This time he sits straight up and holds his stomach in. He yanks at the fabric, and then, in a second, the belt clicks together.  \r\n\r\n“Okay,” Joyce says, “That’ll work out all right, I suppose. Now just one more thing,” she says. She leans over him and starts to push at the armrest. Richard lifts his arms over his head to make it easier for her to do it. She moves the armrest a bit, but then sees that she is pressing it into his flesh, and she notices that his body is taking up a bit of the next seat, too. \r\n\r\n“Mr. Foster,” she says. “I’m sorry, but I’m afraid we have a problem here. Both armrests have to be able to go down all the way.”\r\n\r\nRichard forces at the armrest for a while, but he can’t get it to go down. He takes some breaths and lets his eyes close for a minute. It is clear to Joyce that he is done making jokes. She watches him undo the seatbelt, and she tries to think of something to say. When she opens her mouth to offer her words, she notices that Richard can’t make the armrest move back up again either. He says, “Dear. Oh, will you look at this now,” he says. “Now how do you like this?” and then, “Can you do me a favor, dear?” He raises his arms in the air again, “Can you give it a try for me?”\r\n\r\nJoyce pulls at the armrest but it won’t go. She moves in front of him and gives it a push from that angle, and then she tries it from the other side, too. “Oh, Mr. Foster,” she says, “I can’t get it to budge,” she says. “I’ll have to go and get Charles, or else someone from security—they’d be better at this.”\r\n\r\n“No,” he says. “That won’t be necessary.” He pulls at the armrest some more. He squirms about this way and that, but he is fixed in his place. “Just get my wife,” he says. “I’m sure she can help me with this. She’s done it before, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” Joyce says.\r\n\r\nAs she turns and starts to walk off, Richard says in a soft voice, “I hope you won’t look down on me, dear,” and then, “I’m trying.”\r\n\r\nJoyce hears him. She closes her eyes, but she does not turn around or stop walking. She leaves the plane and walks over to the counter where Charles is standing. The waiting area has filled up, and there is a line now. Eileen notices Joyce get off of the plane, and then she watches her lean in close to Charles and talk for a minute. She sees the smile form on Charles’s face and watches as they both have a laugh together. She knows it has to do with Richard. In a minute, when Charles calls her name over his speaker, Eileen follows Joyce onto the plane.  \r\n\r\n“Oh. Perfect,” she says when she sees Richard in his seat. “Look at him now,” she says, “He’s stuck.”\r\n\r\n“Come on, honey,” Richard says. “Please. It’s not the time now,” and then, “Just help me out of here,” he tells her.\r\n\r\nEileen shakes her head back and forth. She stares at him for a while, and then she gets this look on her face. She leans in close, like she is going to kiss him, but instead she says, “Fatty-Fatty two by four. You can’t fit through the kitchen door.” She moves her neck around in this way when she says it, and she gets to laughing really hard. She looks over to Joyce for a laugh—like they are in agreement here.\r\n\r\nJoyce turns away. She says, “I tried to pull the armrest up myself, but I couldn’t manage it,” and then, “He said you’ve helped him with this sort of thing before.”\r\n\r\nEileen stops smiling and glares at her husband. “Yes,” she says, “With this sort of thing.” She seems to be contemplating something, and Joyce is not sure what will happen next. After a few minutes of standing there, Eileen steps over Richard’s feet and sits down in the window seat next to him. She turns her body so that she is facing him. She puts her feet up against his middle, and she says, “Now lift your arms, Fat Boy,” and then she forces her feet into different parts of his stomach.\r\n\r\n“Christ,” Richard says, “Your heels.”\r\n\r\n“You be quiet,” she tells him, and then she looks at Joyce, pointing to the armrest with her free hand. She says, “Now give it a try.”\r\n\r\nJoyce pulls at the armrest but it doesn’t move. Eileen presses her feet deeper into her husband’s flesh, and Richard lets out a whimper. Joyce gives the armrest another try, and this time it goes up.\r\n\r\nRichard does not say anything for a while. He just sits there. He looks at the floor. He seems smaller to Joyce, next to his wife. After a time, he stands up and wipes some sweat from his forehead with his sleeve. Joyce notices all of the shoe prints on his jacket, and she looks away. Something big is going to happen here, she thinks. But Richard just leans over to his wife and kisses her on her forehead in this really gentle way. He looks at her in the face for a while. Neither one of them says anything.\r\n\r\n.  .  .\r\n\r\nThat night, for the first time in a while, Joyce goes straight home after work. She puts her son in his little bed early, and then she looks through her bookcase and finds her Bible. She puts it on her bedside table and opens it. She reads a few lines from the page she opens to, and then she does up a nice dinner for her husband. She is careful about how much gravy she puts on his meat, and she does not use butter with the mashed potatoes. In bed, she tells him about it. She tells him about how fat the man was, and about how he sells Bibles, from door to door. She tells him about how the man was stuck and about how his wife kicked at him right in his middle. She tells him about all of the nasty things the woman said and how when it was all finished, she thought there was going to be some big fight. She’d have to call security to break it up, but then instead, the man just gave his wife this really gentle kiss, and she tells him how it made her want to cry when she saw it—when she saw the forgiving.', 'After graduating from Syracuse University with a B.A. in English and Psychology, Mary Jones lived in Boston for several years where she worked as an editor.

(30, 'Reward Posters', 'I\'m awakened by a prodding wet dog nose again, because Princess or Precious or whatever has to piss and shit. Without opening my eyes I can tell that it’s late morning, because it’s hot in my van. I slide open the door, and my Pomeranian passenger hops down to do her business. I sit in the doorframe of the van and stretch my arms and wish I had a cigarette, while I avoid looking directly at what my new canine friend unleashes on the earth. When she’s done, she climbs her tiny front paws up my legs and stares at me, tongue out and tail wagging. I pet her well-groomed head and we take off.\r\n\r\nI stole her. I’ve stolen dozens just like her. I take dogs from only the finest suburban neighborhoods. The best time to do this is in the middle of the day while the maid is cleaning. This means the wife went shopping and the husband went working.\r\n\r\nThe maid throws the dog in the backyard and listens to her iPod while she vacuums and Swiffers and steals seventy-five cents for the toll way. Clearly the best time to steal a dog. The neighbors aren’t home. The neighbors are shopping and working, too. The only people in these mini-mansions are maids, poor things.\r\n\r\nWhen I first started, I used to be careful and elaborate (official-looking hat, clipboard), but now I just walk in the backyard and take them.\r\n\r\n.  .  .\r\n\r\nThe first time I stole a dog was a couple of years ago after I had gone to see a movie by myself, which I had never done before. I had been working the graveyard shift at UPS since I graduated high school five years prior. I didn’t really have any friends left from my high school days because of my fucked-up schedule, so the only people I ever had the opportunity to hang out with were people from work. Most were mongoloids or ex-cons, and the few who weren’t lacked personality.\r\n\r\nOne day I was watching TV alone in my efficiency like usual, and this preview came on for a very awesome-looking action movie with promises of comic relief. I convinced myself that seeing a movie alone was better than sitting alone in my apartment.\r\n\r\nI got to my seat during the last preview. It was the first show of the day so there were only a handful of people in the theater. Half an hour into the movie I had finished my popcorn, and I’d rolled my eyes probably fifty times. The movie sucked. I was looking around at the other people in the theater to see if they were as unimpressed as I was. If they were, they weren’t showing any outward signs of it. I thought about how if I left right then, I could still get my money back. The movie had no redeeming value, and I wondered how such a stupid piece of shit could have made it to the theaters. I knew I needed to leave.\r\n\r\nI stayed though, and when I left the theater I was pissed off at myself for wasting eight dollars. Why didn’t I just leave? I repeated to myself over and over on the ride home. The whole reason I went to a movie by myself was so I could do something like leave in the middle of it, and I just sat there like an asshole. But, if I hadn’t left the movie when I did, and if I hadn’t been sufficiently pissed off and ready to give up on normal life, the whole dog stealing thing wouldn’t have started.\r\n\r\nI pulled up to a stop sign, brows furrowed and muttering to myself, and I noticed a dog sniffing around a telephone pole. I looked slightly higher up on the pole, and saw a reward sign describing that same dog. My heart started beating fast because I thought I might scare away the money. I opened my van door slowly and quietly.\r\n\r\n“Come here, buddy,” I tried to sound as loving as possible and held out my hand. It didn’t matter how I sounded though because my hands reeked of popcorn. The dog didn’t hesitate for a second. It walked over and started licking my hands viciously. I picked it up and said, “You just made my day,” or something like that. When I returned the lost pet, the owner was grateful to the tune of three-hundred dollars. That was a few years ago, and I’ve been doing this ever since.\r\n\r\n.  .  .\r\n\r\nBy now I’ve stolen so many dogs that it’s become routine, a full time job. I don’t even have to stop my van to feed the dog that I stole two days ago. I have a huge bag of dog chow in the van, within arm’s reach, but not enough money to buy myself a sandwich. I dunk a small bowl into the chow, place it in front of my latest abductee, and decide we should wait until after noon, so I just keep driving around.\r\n\r\nI leave the windows down because I don’t have A/C, and I notice for the first time that she doesn’t stick her head out the window like most dogs do. She kind of makes me feel like I should entertain her, tell some jokes or something, break the ice. Every now and then I detect a pronounced sigh of boredom. She is a weird dog. She reminds me of myself sitting in that theater wanting to leave but not being able to, which has been on my mind lately.\r\n\r\nIt’s noon now, so the owner is probably luncheon-ing with her classy bitch friends, distracted. I stop at a park to stretch my legs and use the payphone. While my stolen dog struggles tirelessly against its short leash trying to sniff passing dogs’ asses, I make the call.\r\n\r\n“Hello?” I hear from the other end. A woman’s voice.\r\n\r\n“Hi, uh, I just wanted to let you know that I found your dog,” I say. She tells some people in the background to quiet down. I can hear giggling and forks hitting plates. I was right, she is at lunch.\r\n\r\n“Where was she?” she asks.\r\n\r\n“Well, I was driving home from work and I saw her digging in some garbage cans,” I say. I have said that sentence so many times that I wonder for a moment if I don’t sound convincing enough. “It was off of Raymond Street, near that Shell station,” I add for authenticity. I don’t mention the reward sign. It’s too obvious. I’m just doing a good deed.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment of silence, she clears her throat. “Okay, great,” she says. “I’ll be home at about two. Do you think you could bring her by?”\r\n\r\n“Sure thing,” I say.\r\n\r\n“What did you say your name was?”\r\n\r\nI had forgotten to think of a name again. I try never to use the same name in case anyone ever catches on. I quickly utter, “James,” a default name. I’ve become sloppy.\r\n\r\n“Um... Okay,” she says. “Do you know how to get to the house?”\r\n\r\n“Let’s see, her tag says Leary Lane. That’s off Riverdale, right?”\r\n\r\n“Right. Okay, James, thanks. I’ll see you at two.”\r\n\r\nAfter we hang up, I look out over the park, watch some dogs running around. Something was off about that call. She didn’t seem very excited about getting her dog back. Owners always sound so excited to find out that their dog didn’t get sucked into the undercarriage of an eighteen-wheeler. They always assume the worst and are therefore usually thrilled, sometimes very emotional when I call them, but she sounded almost apathetic. This worries me.\r\n\r\nPeople generally tend to think that their dogs care about them, that their dogs will miss them, and won’t simply love the next human with a bag of Beggin’ Strips. I mean, they don’t know it’s not bacon. The dogs don’t seem to care at all when I liberate them. Why would they? A dog is always willing to go on an unexpected adventure, because dogs weren’t really meant to be held captive the way they are, humanized. So when I steal a dog, I leave the gate open so it’s not the dog’s fault for running away. Someone, probably some thoughtless kid trying to retrieve a wayward ball, left the gate open and Fluffy ran away.\r\n\r\nRich people love their dogs, and they don’t mind telling other people how much it costs to buy a purebred whose mother was a direct offspring of Westminster Kennel Club’s first place in the sporting breed. This means that the day after a dog escapes, or sometimes that same day, they put signs up.\r\n\r\nI wait until the day after next to call the number from the reward sign. I try my hardest to sound sincere. It’s almost always the wife’s cell phone number. Wives that don’t have jobs, whose jobs are to spend money. Stay-at-home moms who are never home. They’re out paying for mani-pedis and fake tans and babysitters. Professional money spenders. Lucky me.\r\n\r\nSome people just have different concepts of what things are worth. Some will pay twenty-five dollars for a bar of soap or a hundred-and-fifty dollars for a pillow, and therefore don’t mind paying a thousand dollars for a dog. I can’t complain. I usually get a reward of about half of what they paid for the dog originally. Half of an eight-hundred or thousand dollar dog will feed me for a month at least, monetarily speaking. I blow the rest on gas and cigarettes mostly and steal a dog when I know the funds are lowering.\r\n\r\nThe owners feel bad when they see me. I’m visibly poor, they’re visibly rich. They don’t know that I don’t have bills or rent to pay, that I live mostly out of a van, that I drive all over the country, that I have decided to take an intermission during my life. They want to help me, to reach out to someone. I dupe rich people because they can afford to pay the way. I don’t hate them really, they’re just easy targets.\r\n\r\n.  .  .\r\n\r\nHer house looks familiar as I pull up to it. Not because I was here a couple of days ago stealing a dog, but because every house I steal from looks pretty much the same: big and fancy, bricks and façade, beautiful and functional. I ring the doorbell, pooch in hand, and from inside I hear the lady say, “Come in.” As I do so, I set the dog down, and it stays right there and looks straight up at me. I guess it’s used to me, and it either doesn’t care or doesn’t realize that it’s home now.\r\n\r\n“I’m in the kitchen,” calls the lady. “Just have a seat in the living room. I’m fixing her some din-din. I’ll be there in a minute.” The dog runs excitedly towards the voice in the kitchen while I find and sit on a big, comfy love seat. The house smells great. There are scented candles lit on the coffee table.\r\n\r\nI can hear the reunion of dog and master. It’s the same shit as always, “Ooohhh, there you are! I missed you sooo much! Mwah-mwah-mwah.” To me it sounds more like the ch-ching of an old-time cash register.\r\n\r\nAs usual, I admit to myself that it feels great to be in such a nice house, with its AC cranked high and its faux-finished walls giving off that textured feeling of permanence. There is a large portrait of husband and wife hanging above the mantle. They’re dressed in expensive-looking casual wear, and the wife is holding the dog in her lap while the husband hovers behind them both. They’re in their late twenties or early thirties maybe. The wife looks familiar to me, probably because she looks like so many of the women I’ve done this to before.\r\n\r\nShe finally walks into the living room through the entrance behind me, cradling the dog. She sits in the middle of the couch across from me, and smiles.\r\n\r\n“Thank you so much, James,” she says. There is a sense of vacancy in her voice.\r\n\r\n“Oh, of course,” I say. “How’d she get out?”\r\n\r\nShe is staring off to one side and after a brief silence she says, “You don’t remember me, do you?”\r\n\r\nI realize finally why she looked so familiar in the portrait. She was the first, the lady whose dog I found that day after the movie. They must have moved since then. She is noticeably upset that I didn’t recognize her. Or maybe it’s because I didn’t recognize her dog after stealing it the second time.\r\n\r\nI don’t know what to say. I can feel my pulse throbbing in my neck. I swallow hard. I just sit there and watch as she pets her pseudo-child. Why wouldn’t she have called the police? She had obviously figured out my whole scheme while we were on the phone earlier, had known that she was talking to the man to whom she had previously given three-hundred dollars for what she thought was finding her dog.\r\n\r\n“I’ll just go,” I mumble as I stand up. As I begin walking towards the front door, she stands up. The dog in her lap jumps off swiftly and starts wagging her tail frantically.\r\n\r\n“Please,” she almost shouts. “You don’t have to go.” We stand looking at each other for a moment until she walks over and stands right in front of me. I cock my head slightly, confused. My face wants to scrunch sourly in surprise but I keep it together, simply lift my eyebrows. The dog at our feet is the most excited I’ve ever seen her. She is spinning in small circles with her tongue out. She must be able to sense something unusual in her owner.\r\n\r\n“What’s your name?” I ask her, finally noticing how pretty she is. Her breathing is heavy and deliberate. She looks nervous but determined, and blinks a little “I-know-what-the-fuck-I’m-doing” blink, and a “this-is-my-movie-and-I’m-bored” blink. She ignores my question, and instead brings her hands up to my face and pulls me into a soft kiss. I haven’t touched a woman in months, and my brain starts to feel like it’s floating a little. She tastes great, like Listerine and lip gloss, but I can’t help noticing that her hands smell like a mixture of expensive lotion and dog fur.\r\n\r\nShe pushes me back into the love seat and straddles me. My hands are firmly squeezing her waist, and I’m trying to decide if it’s too soon into our tryst to take off her shirt. Part of me thinks that this poised pedigree is ready for me to fill all her cheap fantasies of fucking a young and seemingly insane drifter, like a chapter out of a dime novel. The other part of me is worried that if I have sex with her, I won’t get my reward money.\r\n\r\nJust as my hand finishes snaking its way up the front of her shirt and finds its cupped target, a mechanical hum comes from the direction of the kitchen. It only takes a second to realize that this means her husband just opened the garage door: hopefully it was from halfway down the block. She jumps off my lap and grunts. A quick “come here!” and her obedient furball runs up onto the couch and into her arms.\r\n\r\n“Be cool, follow me” she tells me as she lets out an almost unnoticeable sigh to herself.\r\n\r\nShe means that her husband is about to walk in, and we are supposed to act like we were just talking about how I found their dog off Raymond Street near the Shell station digging in some garbage cans. She grabs me by the hand and we walk to the foyer. She says, “I never told him about you or the reward the first time. I just said she found her way back home.”\r\n\r\nI wonder why, but don’t ask, because we can hear the kitchen door opening. She smiles at her husband when he walks in, holds their dog up to eye level, and says, “Looky who’s back, it’s our little escape artist.” She is an expert liar. What a turn-on.\r\n\r\n“Oh, that’s great, honey!” he says as she hands the dog to him. “Paul Jacobs,” he says, referring to himself as we shake hands. He’s smiling, genuinely happy. I kind of feel bad. He’s obviously a very caring and loving husband who thinks he has provided his wife with everything she could have ever wanted: a nice house, occasional fine dining, rich friends, and of course a primped and prized little bundle of Toy Pomeranian.\r\n\r\n“Hi, I’m James,” I say, also smiling, as I point to their dog. “I found that little trickster rummaging through some garbage. Good thing she has a tag, eh?”\r\n\r\n“It sure is,” he says. “Thanks for getting her back to us, James.” I sense he’s uncomfortable having me in his house, like I might steal pills from a medicine cabinet or something. He wants me out of here. “Did my wife tell you about the reward?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that’s okay,” I lie. I know there’s no way he’ll let me walk out of here without taking his money. He will insist. He saw my van when he pulled up, and he couldn’t consider himself a decent person if he let a sad sack of shit like me walk away empty-handed.\r\n\r\nWhen he hands me the cash, I shake his hand more genuinely than I’ve shaken anyone’s in a long time, and I thank him, having just then decided that I will never steal a dog again. I look over at his wife and nod as I say, “Glad I could help.” She smiles desperately as I raise my hand in an awkward wave goodbye.\r\n\r\nWhen I get onto the highway, I drive my van in the direction of what I used to call home.', 'Cody McCafferty likes cheesy rock riffs and irreverent humor.
